    "description": "Dragon Legend of Zelda: Unification is a quest full of puzzles and secrets that will take some thinking to get through. Features that are usually not in BS Quests have shown up in here including a hookshot, Lens of Truth, Golden Arrows, and more! Also, a warning to beginners. It's recommended you play a few other quests to learn the feel of ZC before playing this quest, as it does assume you have experience.\n\nUPDATES:\n\nThe updated version is just named unification.qst in the zip file. But I'm also bundling the original non-modified release in here as unification-original.qst. Only play that version if you don't want any of the updates listed below. Both versions were still created in 1.90.\n \nUPDATE 1.0.2 (7/29/2014):\n\n1. Hopefully fixed a dead end in level 8 that forced you to do a continue warp.\n2. Fixed a block \"puzzle\" in level 2 that would trap you in a block and force you to do a continue warp if you came into the room at the wrong direction.\n3. Hopefully fixed all instances where I used cancel warps so that later ZC versions don't randomly have wavy warps that go nowhere. If you still find some of these, please let me know.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.1 (7/24/2014):\n\nThis is an extremely minor update that does 3 things.\n\n1. Fixed the final boss. Yes, there was supposed to be a final boss. Boss flags and level numbers made him not appear. \n2. Significantly dulled the palettes of level 7, 8, and 9 (green and red). I have no idea how pre-teen me could handle staring at those palettes since they make me dizzy looking at them for a few minutes. The dull colors are by no means great, but I can at least look at them. I have not updated the screenshots to reflect this change.\n3. Added an open door to the room that had a bunch of Pols Voice in level 3. I had never intended for the player to be forced to fight those with the wooden sword or even the level 2 sword and somehow legitimately thought you got the arrows before reaching them. This goes to show how awesome I was at not beta testing anything I made during this time period.\n\nYou're maybe wondering why I'm not bothering to update more despite fixing these issues. Truth be told, I want to keep this up as it is mostly as a record of what I did with my first (and still currently only at the time of writing this) released quest. Doing any major changes to it would ruin that. Of course I'm fully aware that modern ZC players that stumble on this update might play the quest and go \"what is this crap!?\" because of many of my more questionable design decisions (and believe me, there are plenty of them), but that's totally fair since standards change and this was honestly kind of average at most even for the time in my opinion. My own standards have changed since making this and I feel that I've grown as a quest maker since then.\n\nStill, there were people that had fun playing it and I admit I have fun going back and playing it every so often even if I cringe at some of the things I did. So that's why I decided to go through with submitting this update to fix these issues that have irked me for years.\n\nAlso, if there are any other bugs, feel free to mention them and I'll try to fix them if I can. Keep in mind that I'm using 1.90 and DOSBox is a huge pain to operate, so I may not get to everything.",
    "story": "Link is resting in his home one day when Abei appears from nowhere. He tells Link that Ganon found out where the secret island of the Dragon Triforce is and that he kidnapped Zelda as well. Abei then tells Link that big long legend you just read! Link want's to follow Zelda. Abei opens a book and chants a funny incantation. A stairway appears on the floor! Link walks in, and finds himself in a pitch black room! The mist in the room causes Link to pass out! He wakes up to find himself on an island shoreline. Wrote in the sand near the water is:\"Welcome to Dragon Island, the island out of normal human reach!\"The tide comes in and covers the message. Link sudden finds an octorock rushing towards him, ready for the kill (screen to the left of start). Link reaches for his sword, but it is not there. Neither is any of his other gear. The mist had took it from him and scattered it around the island! Also, Ganon had stolen the Master Sword and hid it in his hideout! Ganon also has several fake triforces that Link will have to collect to escape certain rooms! You will determain what Link will do!

    "description": "I started this quest before I first joined AGN back in October of 2000.... It was the first quest I worked on, and the last I'll work on... When it started it was BS-Style all the way... Then I started editing tiles, and added every feature I could possibly think of... then I stopped working on it for a long time...like six months...\n\nWhen I got a craving to work on it again, I came back to it, and 1.90 had just come out, I had to completely upgrade the quest to make room for the new items like the boots and the hookshot... I wanted to have all the possible features.... I came close to finishing the quest, but put it away for a while....\n\nAbout eight or so months later, Dark Nation has put out 1.92 build 163 (or whatever it was) and I get a craving to work on it again... I made so many edits and changes to this damned quest that I think it can't be anything but good at this point, so I'm determined to finish it... I still had much to do, four more underworlds, and quite a bit of fixing up.... \n\nAnd I lost all motivation... I didn't want to see the quest die. Damn i'd worked on it so long I wanted like hell to finish it.... but I knew I never would....\n\nAt the time JayeM was beta testing for me, and we would get to talking about the quest a lot.... and I knew she was very interested in the quest, but I felt so bad for not being able to finish it... So I figured Since I like her quest building style, and I certainly trust her judgment implicitly... I decided to give the quest to JayeM, because I know how much life she'd be able to breathe into it...\n\nThat was a few months ago... two I think... and she's done extraordinarily well with it... adding almost all of the new features from the new beta, developing the remaining dungeons that needed to be finished, as well as expand on the overworld a bit and add new sub levels... \n\nNow the time has come for her to need a beta tester, and I'm doing it myself. Bigjoe has also been beta testing, and has done a terrific job. He also helped out by adding new BS Enemies created by VEL. Special thanks to him.\n\nAnyways, I am truly amazed at how solid a quest this really is. I'm proud to have worked on it for so long, and I'm proud to have JayeM as it's other parent. I hope you'll all enjoy this quest as much as I do.",

I have yet to topple this contribution of mine to the Zelda Classic library. It houses 9 complete dungeons with a optional 'master' dungeon which is quite deviously hidden and poses a interesting challenge once inside. This uses the BS tileset to its fullest potential and I dare say it rivals Revenge 1 in terms of scope and quality as well as challenge. Level 8 and 9 have to be seen to be believed, the epitome of great BS tile dungeon design. A great quest in all aspects, highly recommended.\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Fixed misc. bugs, made sure all continue bugs squashed, and made various detail touch-ups across the board.\n3/25/07 - Fixed a fatal bug where you could do level 7 out of order and get yourself permenently stuck!",

Addition of boss keys and various graphical enhancements like shadows and bush clippings. Added many new things and re-arranged things to how I really wanted it to be when I looked back on the original quest in retrospect and wasn't happy with some of it. This is the definitive version of Hidden Duality, it has it all and then some.\n\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Fixed all Dodongo disappearing bugs, tried to squash the level 4 continue bug as best I could, altered various enemy placements throughout the quest. Made minor detail touch-ups across the board and finally eliminated that infinite rupee supplying bush combo in the snow area.",

    "story": "After Link saved Hyrule from the evil grasp of Ganon the kingdom of Hyrule prospered as a major center of trade.  Three other kingdoms called Tenn, Montar, and Frellan arose around Hyrule, as a result of its expansion.  Link put his weapons in the royal armory, because he had no need for them any longer, and the Triforce was placed in the throne room and heavily guarded.  Link moved to the kingdom of Tenn and began to raise a family.  But one fateful day Link was killed by a group of angry moblins; not even his great skill could save him.  For over 10 years Hyrule reigned as the largest kingdom in the world, but the remaining band of Ganon's army sought tirelessly to revive their once great leader.  After 11 long years they finally suceeded.  Ganon easily retook the Triforce in the absense of Link and brought Hyrule to its knees.  9 years later Ganon grew angry because even though he destroyed Hyrule, the three daughter kingdoms still prospered, so he sought to capture and destroy them as well.  He began by kidnapping the princess Julie of Frellan.  Then Ganon created strong-holds (in each Ganon put Link's weapons to keep them from any adventurous soul) in each of the kingdoms and sent his armies out to destroy the land.  Now it is up to Link's son, also named Link, to gather his father's weapons and destroy Ganon in the Dead Land.",

Old save files should work with this new quest file. If you downloaded a copy of the quest before July 6th, 2014, get the updated version linked here.This quest features a full overworld and about a dozen underworlds. It is relatively difficult, so I recommend playing it with a gamepad/controller rather than with the keyboard. PLAY THIS QUEST USING ZELDA CLASSIC 1.90 ONLY! Zelda Classic 1.90 is a DOS program, so your computer needs to be able to run DOS games to run 1.90.[If you cannot run Zelda Classic 1.90, 1.92 b184 should work sufficiently to accomplish all of the main objectives of the quest. If you can't run any 1.9X versions, don't bother trying 2.1X versions. 2.5X versions might lead to troubles that require quitting and loading game save files.]This game is free. I don't profit from it and, by downloading, you agree not to, either. Some of the tiles were taken from other games, but almost all have been uniquely modified. Any perceived trademark is parodied or unintentional. If you have a problem with the game, don't download it and/or delete it from your computer. Any possible adverse effects to your computer (and the systems networked with it) that may be the result of downloading and executing the file are your risks that are to be remedied at nobody's expense beyond your own.",

You notice, however, that enemies stand in your way and the twins seem to have locked themselves in their bedroom. After defeating those that interfere, one of the ladies explains that a wolf has stolen away her sister and, more importantly, her Gameboy. Vowing to return with it (and her), you set off, mowing down the evildoers. With the ground thoroughly searched, you realize you will have to use the lessons of your dreams in real life and use your waking experience in lucid dreams, if you are to secure the units necessary to find the Gameboy and \"What's-Her-Name?\"...And so much more, like some deal about an \"Octoforce\" or something.

He's told by the old man that he shouldn't make his escape without a weapon and you could can guess that he'll have to fight his way out. However, this time there is no Ganon to beat. Only creatures and minions that always have roamed Hyrule and its hidden labyrinths. But they protect all of the tools Link will need to leave his homeland.",

    "description": "It borrows from the Wind Waker concept of a world with a big ocean; with islands dotting the landscape. Well since ZC is on a screen by screen basis, screens of just simply water would be boring as hell to travel through. So except in certain cases, there will be land in almost every screen on the massive 16x16 overworld. So its like Wind Waker, but the island are more jam-packed together. This prevents long sailing times on the raft and later, long swim times with the flippers. So I hope this speeds things up a bit.\nAnyway, there will be some story in the form of Aryll, your sister and townspeople in your home town, Goron City and Zora Cave. After levels 1, 7 and 8, you can return to these towns and get new information out of them and get a new item from Aryll.\nNow the game starts off on your home island and you MUST complete level 1 and then visit Aryll to get the raft so you can get off your island and explore the ocean. Now from here on in, you have FREE exploration through almost ALL the islands and areas of the huge overworld. You can tackle levels 2-7 in ANY order you choose. With the small exception of gaining flippers from level 5 to access level 6. Other than that, you are free to go and do what you want and where you want. Just note that the further dungeons you skip to, the harder it will be on you since you may have fewer hearts early in the game. \nNow as for secrets, here is a list:\n- 2 HC Pieces on each major island\n- 4 HC Pieces in 4 separate mini-dungeons found underwater in the vast ocean\n- 6 Magic upgrades on 6 minor islands\n- 8 Bomb upgrades on 8 major islands\n- 3 Extra required dungeons including the new optional Master Dome\n- Tons and Tons of rupees found on land, underwater, or found by defeating all enemies on certain overworld screens.\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Use beta 183 to play this!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nVer. 1.3 - Added more raft paths to make the overworld a bit more accessible. Added some more free super bombs due to complaints of players. Decreased the price on super bombs and magic shields in shops around the overworld. Should play smoother now.\nVer. 1.4 - Added a new mini-dungeon and added another raft path. Fixed  some more bugs and finished up with the suggestions made from the forums.\nVer. 1.5 - Fixed a potion shop in the 'dead town' so those player with no potions leftover from level 8 can have some relief.\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Tried to squash as many Level A, B, C continue bugs as possible, even to the point that you can no longer start in those dungeons anymore. I hope the problem is fixed now. Also made general detail touch ups across the board.\nUpdate: Replaced the missing readme file mentioned in this description!",

While not quite as difficult as AlphaDawg's \"ZC official\" 3rd Quest, it will still provide Zelda experts with a considerable challenge and lots of interesting puzzles.\n\nFor those of you who are not *quite* skilled enough to consider yourselves Zelda \"experts,\" the quest comes with a complete FAQ/walthrough, written in question-hint-answer format, so that it won't take away the fun of figuring things out yourself.\n\nMaster Quest was built from BS 1st, as you can see, but numerous subtle improvements have been made including custom tiles, layering, landscape \"manicuring,\" area-specific MIDI themes, a new overworld palette, and even lowercase letters!  As for big changes, there is an entirely new overworld area for you to find and explore, and of course every dungeon is a completely new level.\n\nTo maintain the \"old school\" feel, I've purposely used only the original Zelda items, enemies, and bosses, and most of the other Zelda conventions from the original game still apply. The best way to prepare for Master Quest is to replay the original 2nd Quest. \n\nDespite these limitations, Master Quest's dungeons are huge compared to the original Zelda. It should provide even speedy players with more than 10 hours of gameplay.",

So in a way, this quest has been in the making for 16 years. Enjoy. ",

Some of them are false walls.\n- If there are items you *know* you will need eventually, try to buy or find them as early as you can. MQ GREATLY rewards foresight.\n- Refer to the subscreen map often in dungeons. Mark unexplored areas, and remember where you need to go.  Backtrack often!\n- If you're stuck, search the overworld for hint-giving old men.  In MQ they really are helpful!\n\nIf all else fails, check the FAQ included in the zip file for hint-a-licious assistance.",

    "description": "(This quest was created by Phantom Menace and completed by Nightmare...)Back in 1999, Phantom Menace and I were working together on Zelda Classic (pretty much just us), and we made two separate quests. One was New Quest (mine) as everyone knows, the other was the Demo Quest, supposedly the try-out field for new features BEYOND Zelda Classic. As you know, New Quest was honored and remembered.Sadly, for our creator of Zelda Classic, Demo Quest never got finished as PM got sidetracked.So in the summer of 2004, five years later, I asked for permission to finish off Demo Quest to satisfy the urges of the oldbies wanting to save Zelda in that quest, as well as make it playable (if you thought James Quest 2 or Mega Man: DWR DC were hard, pick up Demo Quest from the AGN DB. Makes both of those look easy!) I was successful in updating and adding a lot of ZC's new features and tricks into Demo to re-create the feel it had back in 1999, with new features as well. It's also MUCH more playable now. Unfortunately, much as I love his work, PM tended to be a much better Zelda player than me and his quests were designed that way. Everyone should have a chance now rather than just 3-4 players.Updated 02/09/05 to fix bug in Level 4.Updated April 2015 to version 2.50.Patch 3 Notes 5/31/20171. Wizzrobes fixed2. Some warps fixed3.

Usually you'd need the Mirror Shield to battle such a monstrosity, but there's a way to beat him if you notice his patterns. There isn't anything else in the room to worry about and no extra heads to worry about, so just hide in the corner. His fire cannot hit you! When the head goes to the other side, the fire will be out of range. Move up, throw sword beams, go back to the corner until it's out of range. Get one of the previous Potions if you don't have full life or use the Quick Save to get full life.3. Cheat Codes in the extra area, if you can decipher the riddles.",

    "description": "Here is Molka, a Quest I finished 2 or 3 years ago. Now you're probably thinking, \"Old graphics? Are you kidding me?\" Well, here's my wisdom; this Quest will prove that Quests can still be good if they're in the old graphics. This Quest contains 13 levels (all required to win) and a whole lotta things to uncover. Along with the old gfx are many custom-drawn gfx that I drew myself (the gfx themselves weren't all that hard to draw; it's the COMBOS that really rock), and also don't forget that the music that comes with this Quest is, in more than my own opinion, excellent.\n\nBefore you begin, remember that this Quest is a challenging one. The levels are not ridiculously hard, but they do make you think. Lots of puzzles are in this Quest...  trust your gizmos.\n\nSo, for your enjoyment, I give you...  MOLKA!!\n\n***Updated 8/14/07*** Fixed some long-outstanding bugs, such as not being able to exit from a later dungeon until you've beaten it (and that dungeon required Bait too, so O_o on that), various Continue bugs (though they're not eliminated, they are now no longer game-stopping) and I also removed the things the Bosses say to you when you fight them 'cause Link can't move and the Boss often can get in a free hit. Not cool. Lastly, I added 4 new screenshots. ",
    "story": "Molka is a mountain land, inhabited by strong, hearty folks. This land was peaceful enough, as Ganon had never touched the place. Well, THAT'S because Ganon did NOT know that Molka had a triforce of it's own! The Triforce of Gizmos allowed it's owner mastery over his or her items. Link could've used something like this in his first adventure, couldn't he? Well, also in Molka were new items that Link or anyone in Hyrule had never heard of before. The Whistle of the Winds was an example.\n\n  Ganon always seems to revive himself after being defeated, huh? It's true. Link and Ganon have faced off so many times it's not even funny. (That's thanks to anyone who's ever made a Zelda Classic Quest!) So, Ganon revives himself again and goes at it, thinking of another way to defeat Link. After 3 days of thinking, Ganon bolts out of his chair and yells, \"I HAVE IT! I know how to defeat Link! I just have to kidnap Zelda to a land with tougher enemies!\" All his minions applauded. What a plan! It was brilliant!\n\n  Ganon sent out scouts to find a land with really hard enemies. They found one: Molka. \"Great job, boys!\" Ganon said to the scouts. \"Let's prepare to strike!\" And with that, Ganon and his minions started building the Dark Base, a floating dungeon that could travel anywhere. In 2 weeks, it was finished. Ganon took Zelda the next night, as she was walking out on her balcony to gaze at the stars, and transported her up into the Dark Base. Then they flew to the mountain of Molka, putting Ganon's plan fully in action. Ganon just had to wait for Link.\n\n  The Hyrulians didn't panic. This has happened before. Zelda's been kidnapped a lot, so they knew the drill. Rebuild the Triforce, send Link to Level 9, defeat Ganon. Right? Well, that's when the Hyrulian messenger reported that Ganon escaped to Molka. OOPS, this ain't part o' the drill! NOW they panicked. But Link didn't. Already he was thinking of a way to get to Molka.\n\n  He went home that night with no plan. His sidekick, a Wind Wizzrobe (who he met secretly in A Link to the Past), tried to cheer him up a bit. He knew how to play Link's whistle better than Link, so he played a song for him. Link didn't cheer up. \"I've been on many adventures before, but Molka...  I don't even know where Molka is!\" The Wizzrobe stopped playing and looked at Link, hard. \"Did you say, MOLKA?\" Silence. \"Link, I lived in Molka during your first adventure! I know where it is!\"\n\n  By the next day, Link was prepared to go. The laws of Molka stated that most Hyrulian items were not allowed within the land. So, Link was bringing his Boomerang, Wooden Sword, and a Blue Potion with him. Even the Red Ring stayed behind. Once he was all ready, the Wind Wizzrobe blew him in a tornado to the city in Molka. It worked!\n\n  Now, Link knew where he had to go. The Triforce of Gizmos, still undetected by Ganon, was hid away hundreds of years ago in 8 pieces, each piece inside one of the dangerous Forts of Molka. These Forts also contained legendary Molkian items (like the Whistle of the Winds), allowing Link even more power. Only once Link had completely mastered his items would he be able to reach the Dark Base floating over the northeastern corner of Molka. And the best part is, Ganon doesn't even know Link is prepared so well. He doesn't know what he's askin' for!!!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "-Molka's Forts are chalk full of secret passages. Try getting the Map as soon as possible so you can find these passages better. Even without the Map, once you've gotten far enough in the Quest, you'll just know where things are.\n\n -Ganon's right about tougher enemies. In the later levels, you may be fighting a whole room of Blue Darknuts, or even 4 Manhandlas! There are Potion shops about, MAKE GOOD USE OF 'EM.\n\n -Statues are everywhere on the mountain. Use an item on them that they relate to, to clear a path. Memorize the paths on this mountain, learn 'em well. As you collect items from the Forts, you'll definitely need to move backward in order to move forward.\n\n -You can carry a maximum of 20 Bombs, once you find the shops. Some items are extremely rare and not required to win. The Magic Key can be bought for 980 Rupees. See, you weren't meant to have it! Try the Gold Ring instead. It's only about 700 Rupees.  \n\n-Like I said above, I made a \"workaround\" for the continue bug if you're using 2.10 instead of 1.92, but this still starts you out in the Boss Room. If you want to stop fighting the Boss over and over and get a potion or whatever, you still have to Quit->Save. It's the best I could manage to be compatible with both 1.92b and 2.10. Nothing major though.",

It has 9+ full levels (some of them with multiple floors or maps), several mini-dungeons, and a full overworld map (half is the Dark World, half the Light World). It uses many of the newer items used in Zelda Classic and should be played using version 2.10.\n\nUpdate: Fixed a warp bug in the mountains that would let the player access the Dark World earlier than planned which can be almost game ending.",
    "story": "Princess Zelda knew that she didn't have much time until evil returned to the land of Hyrule. She decided to head out to a remote island, far from Hyrule, where she could safely hide the Triforce of Wisdom from the clutches of evil. She told no one of her plans except for her noble aid, Impa. As Zelda was trying to hide the last four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom on the island, she was captured by a renegade group of Moblins in the forest. The Moblin tribe was attempting to create an entrance to the Dark World so they could once again be together with their master, Ganon. The Moblins were successful and were able to open a path to the Dark World and turned Zelda over to Ganon. Ganon knew that it wouldn't be long before Link learned of Zelda's fate, so he scattered the other four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom throughout the Dark World. Ganon then commanded the rest of his minions find the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom Zelda hid so that he could claim them as his own. Back in Hyrule, there was much concern when the princess was reported as missing for a long period of time. Impa then decided to seek help with Link, the Hero of Time. When Link learned of Zelda's capture, he immediately set out to rescue her from Ganon's clutches. On the way to the island, his ship was damaged in a storm and he lost all his possessions, becoming shipwrecked on the island. Starting his adventure without even having his trusty sword at his side, Link must find a way to navigate this new island to find the princess and rescue her from Ganon.",

It was originally made before you could link strings together, so in order to get the full story and talk to other characters, you have to pay for info a lot.  But I provide lots of rupees, so don’t worry.  The quest is about Metroids and Samus with cameos from other characters.  It is fairly simple and linear.  It consists of Samus traveling to a series of different planets on her quest to catch Ridley.  The dungeons start out easy, but get a little harder toward the end.  At the very end, I decided that the very last dungeon (with Fett) was a little hard, so I provided a way to view a fast ending in case you don’t want to play all the way through the last dungeon.  But if you do stick with it and beat the entire game, you get a much more rewarding ending.  The storyline may seem a little similar to Meitroid Prime: Hunters, because it’s about Samus battle other bounty hunters, but I actually finished this quest many years before the DS ever came out.  I'm only just now getting around to redoing some tiles and uploading it.",

This quest starts off relatively hard, then lulls you into a false sense of being easy, and then bombards you with the near impossible at the end. Needless to say, it is not for the average Zelda Classic player. So don't complain, you've been warned.",
    "story": "This chapter is sort of an adaptation of many of the LOZ stories. It begins where Link just beat Ganon to save Zelda. However, just because Ganon was defeated and encapsulated in stone doesn't mean that Ganon's minions are gone. On the way back to Hyrule Castle, Link was mobbed by a massive amount of darknuts. Unfortunately, the darknuts overwhelmed Link, and took all of his goods and Zelda. Now Link must save Zelda wherever she is. Link also recalls that Zelda told him of a 'blue Triforce' that, when combined, would let the worthy claim the true Triforces of Power, Courage, and Wisdom. Now Link must set off to save Zelda and claim the 'blue Triforce'.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Tip 1: Don't get frustrated. This quest is not designed to be completed in five minutes. In fact the fastest run I made wasn't less than 10 hours. It is also designed to be tough, but not too tough. So if you are dying consistently, then either you need more hearts or better equipment. Tip 2: Explore everywhere! HCP's are direly needed in the quest as you don't get Heart Containers. The problem is that I counted the number of HCP's and the count comes out different each time. (it is between 81-84 but it really doesn't matter, you'll see why toward the end of the game.) So keep playing. Tip 3: PAY FOR THE HINTS!!! This will REALLY help your progression in the quest. Also, for those who can't get through, I will be making a walkthrough on a site here in the not so distant future, so keep your eyes open. If you have any questions, post them and I will see how to answer them to the best of my ability.\nwww.geocities.com/darthpikachu21/Level1.html",

The Red Candle is needed to reach Level 5.\n3. You'll find the White Sword and Magic Sword in small dungeons with Gleeoks blocking them.\n4. Ganon's tower is 9 floors, you basically have to traverse around 100 total rooms to reach Ganon. He appears twice so be careful.\n5. In rooms with 10 different enemies, make sure you have a potion or full health. There are no fairy ponds in this game so be careful.\n6. Search every room in every dungeon! \n7. Don't be upset if the game is shorter or easier than you imagined. This is my very first quest ever made and I might've screwed up, but enjoy.\n8. Don't worry, the quest is very beatable, but takes some adjusting.\n9. Enjoy the ending.\n10. If the item is stuck on the walls, don't worry about it. Those aren't really needed to beat the game.",

    "story": "intro: \n\tabout 500 years years ago, Link, the hero of time fought an evil man named Ganon inthe land of Hyrule for the power of the triforce, and rescued princess zelda. then something else happend, ganon reterned again, the land of hyrule got flooded, the hero of the winds defeated Ganon AGAIN, founded the new Hyrule, and did some other things. \n\tThen came the mushroom kingdom, the Beanbean kingdom, Tofu, Bowser, Mario, the internet, animation, ETC. ETC. ETC. \n\t\nStory:\n\tthe story starts out as most of wario's bussness ventures do. one day he's laying on the couch and he sees an advertisement on TV. \"NEW! FROM GAMECO! the massivly multiplayer online RPG smash hit that everyone's talking about! WORLD OF EVERLIFE 2! play with people from around the globe! incredibly addicting! only $50 and an additonal $15 a month!\" \n\tso then the microscopic peanut that is wario's brain acheves the following train of thought; \"hey! if I make an addictive-a smash hit thingey, mabey I can-a charge ridiculous amounts of a-money! and the best part is that they'll-a PAY MY HUGE FEES NO MATTER WHAT! but who should I a-chose to be in charge of the project, hmmm... Mona has a job at that pizza place, Jimmy likes go a-goof of and a-dance insted of a-work, Dribble is too big, Spitz is-a to short, orblon only has-a 3 fingers, Dr. Crygor is to-a... err... never mind him, Wait! I have it! I'll get 9-volt to a-do it! he a-loves nintendo games-a so much he cant say no to me! unless Mario (blech!) a-tells him not-a to. but what are the odds of-a that? mwa ha ha! I'm so smart!\" \n\tjust as wario expected, 9-Volt agreed to make the game so 9-Volt got a new computer with a 999 Gigahertz pressesor,a 500 gigabyte hard drive, and a neat-o USB controller. a few weeks later, the game was open for a private Gamma test (a gamma test is like a beta test only more so) and 9-volt just finished tranfering his entire NES game collection to the hard drive of the computer when 9-volt, to his horror acidently hit the \"transfer all dowloaded data to game and scatter about in the form of the Triforce\" button (who's Idea was to put a button that did that?) so 9-volt went and played the game to find all 8 peces of the triforce, and at the same time stop the illigal hacking going on in the game. \n\t9-volt thought \"let's start in hyrule....",

The dungeon is divided into 9 long hallways called stages. You fight enemies and keep going. There is no turning back. If you reach the second half of the stage, you can continue from that point if you die. You finish the stage after you beat the boss and get the triforce piece. Then you move on to a new stage. That is all there is to it. Good Luck!\n\nUses the arrows as spending money and a weapon.\n\nUPDATE: I added the rule that you continue from what stage you left off, not at the start to go to stage one, but you start at first half. Fixed minor bugs. Read the new tips and revisions of the tips at the Tips and Cheats section.\n\nUPDATE: Eliminated the three click sound when entering the second half.  Gotten rid of the map paper in the subscreen and the dots by changing its color to black. Fixed the fairy position in the room before the fight of Ganon.",

She found a nice Giant empty dungeon and she thinks it's a good place to hide the shards. She hid them in eight large hallways and then to leave this place.\n\nWhen she tried to leave, monsters were there that blocked her way. She knew she is in danger. Ganon appears and captures her once again.\n\nZelda called for Link with a cry for help. Link hears her voice and follows it. Then notices the Giant dungeon shrouded in dark clouds. Now this starts his quest to save Zelda once again by adventuring through the Giant dungeon's hallways to success.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "A cheat code is available in stage 9. Located close to the entrance of second half portion of the stage. It is hidden.\n\nWatch the borders of the stairs tile. If it is a light border, enter and get something good,or takes you back to the entrance of the first half. If you enter the stairs tile with a dark border, it zaps you out of the dungeon and you have to enter stage one! Avoid those stairs with a dark border.\n\nIf you are stuck, try pushing blocks. If one moves, the shutter will open and you can progress. \n\nStage 4, second half, next room after entrance, one block can be pushed (after all enemies beaten) will open the stairs that you get a large quiver.\n\nWhen you fight peahats, wait until one stops, then inflict damage by stabbing.\n\nRemember that stages 2-9, the fourth room after the entrance of first half, you have to pay the amount of arrows to the Moblin or lose a heart container to pass to the fifth room. You will die if you have one life heart left. As you go to higher stages, the price of arrows raise.\n\nThe room in Stage 9 Second Half, where wizzrobes and the stars that make you invincible, there is a walk-thru wall to the right that takes you to a fight for another red potion.",

I put a lot of side quests in the quest so it can have a feel to most Zelda games. The storyline fits into the major storyline and I do try to connect them all together. I spent a lot of time on the storyline and I hope you like it. This is what you can expect from the quest:-Travel through huge Forests, islands, caves, deserts, graveyards, mountains, towns, as well as Dreams.-Come face to face to some of the old Hero's of Hyrule.-Meet different cultures and races of Hyrule.-Fight some original custom bosses like Wolfblin and King Dodongo.-Play some great mini games like bow and arrow target practice and rafting.-See some original puzzles never seen in ZC.-Huge Dungeons with different themes.-and More!10/12/2011 Update - 5 years later, I came back and polished the game up. Here are some of things I added:-Donmore's Cave is redesigned!-Wondering Tree is redesigned!-The Thieves' Hideout is redesigned!-The Irony Cave is redesigned!-The Grave Cave is added.-New puzzles in some of the levels, as well as some hints to make puzzles more clear.-String Count went from 1400 to 2000!-Cave of Ordeals added!-Extra Level and Extra Ending for those Hardcore players!-And a lot more...

    "story": "On a small island just outside of Hyrule lived a boy named Link. As he grew up, he knew he was destined to become the new Hero of Hyrule. The Robins who were neighbors of Link, told him that the bloodline of the Hero’s past through him. He knew that on any given day his adventure could begin.One day Link was drawing a picture of a sword on the mountainside of the island. He looked down at his shield that he always kept with him, and thought how cool it would be to finally use it with a sword of his own. Just then his good friend Patty walked over to him. She looked a little sad, as she told him that she was going to leave the island soon in search for the Shooting Star Legend. In that moment, they both looked at the shoreline and noticed that the water was acting very violent. But they brushed it off. As Link finished the drawing, he signed his name on the bottom of the sword. Patty was still talking about that legend; however, Link couldn’t keep his eyes off the coastline, which was getting worse by the second.Little did they know, the Dark Army had just docked south of the city of Fulton. The Commander of the Army stepped out to dock while discussing the plan to this staff, “Continue searching for the remaining Triforce pieces. We will capture Fulton and await you there!” As the Commander looked at the path to Fulton, he whispered to himself, “And now it begins.”",
    "tipsAndCheats": "First of all don’t use any cheats on this game because of the amount of events I put in this game. Second this game is huge. Expect 15-25 hours on this game. If you don’t like huge games I say pass it up. Third, the game does get a little hard. I suggest you getting POTIONS whenever possible. You are going to die quite a bit, but don’t worry you will end up passing it. If you have any questions ask in the forum and I will help you out. Also make sure to read the story because they give you a lot of hints for things you need to do.\n\nAlso here is a link to my Director's Commentary on my game.

    "description": "UPDATE: To eliminate the crashing of the Zelda Classic Program on certain computers, I have to move the pond in the overworld from screen 00 to 01. Same function. Swim to the side to get the hookshot. Hopefully it is solved. I fixed the freeze bug at the dark realm entrance by removing the intro message \nand added the rule that you can continue from this place if a wallmaster grabs you or if you die.\n\nUPDATE: I modified the sanctuary room. The item is placed above the exit, makes it so you can get the item before you leave the sanctuary so players won't miss the item. The lamp was required for level 2. Revised information in the Tips and Cheats.\n\nThe water layer is a transparent layer. Make sure the \"Show Trans. Lyrs.\" in the Settings command is on to see.\n\nThe Three triforce, Known as the Triforce of Wisdom, Power, and Courage was suddenly stolen by possessed guards and scattered the shards into dungeons! Restore the Three triforce and find out.\n\nQuest made with BS and some tiles from Pure.\n\nMany Mini-games in this quest!",

    "tipsAndCheats": "Cheat code is available at the end of the game.\n\nWhite trees can be burned down.\n\nThere can't be a level 4 cheat. The 60 second countdown (from BH4) is being used as an misc. item and placed out of reach. It is to be used as a timer for mini-games. And the 3 second timer is subsituting as a Master Sword. If I had the level 4 cheat available, timers can be picked up if the \"no walls\" function is on and there won't be a timer in the Mini-Game. \nIn short, the cheat code you get when you beat the quest is a Level 3 cheat.\n\nThere will be walk-through walls on dungeon levels 3-6. Here is a hint to get the legendary items in an unmapped room. Level 4, while you are about to ride the first minecart, walk-through wall is above. Go through it and you can get the Farore's Wind. Level 5, after you rode the minecart, behind the pots is a walk-through wall. Get the Nayru's love. Level 6, in a room where there is just a rectangular lava, the right side is bombable. \nEnter through it and get the magic key. Don't leave the room yet, the right wall is a walk-through to get Din's fire. The legendary items are as the items from SNES A link to the past. Bombos medallion is Din's fire, Ether medallion is Nayru's love and quake medallion is Farore's wind.\n\nThere are unmapped rooms in all dungeons where there is 10 rupies. Accessed by blowing a hole in the wall by a bomb.\n\nLink's bed at Link's house is also a life restoring room. Walk to the far right side of the bed to restore Life energy.\n\nBe sure to buy the arrows at the village before going to the level 2 dungeon. Also you may need to buy an extra key before going in dungeon levels 2, 3, 5 and 6 (even 7 but if you've found the magic key in 6, you don't have to worry). Hint: Super bombs, key and stairs can be under any Armos statue.\n\nThe cactus that has no spikes can be pushed up to enter the shop.",

I hope you have as much fun playing this quest as it was designing it!  \n\nUPDATED 6.8.06 Because of stupid mistake on my part.\n\nUPDATED 6.18.06 Fixed the bombable walls in Level Three.\n\nUPDATED 11.4.06 A slightly bigger update:\n\n1. Fixed the number of continue hearts from 50% to 6. Makes it a little fairer for players in the beginning but a little more difficult as you get far into the quest.\n\n2. Changed the music for Level One.\n\n3. It is now possible to find a blue potion before Level Two. Players of this quest will know what I'm talking about. My advice is to not use it until you get to Level Two. No, I didn't change the Level 2 block puzzle. Deal with it.\n\n4.

    "description": "This quest was made, completed and finished within 3 months about 8 months ago. (about March or April of this year) But it was delayed in release because Petoe and I wanted it to be a simultaneous release with Lost Isle. But since Lost Isle is being delayed for a while due to quality assurance and other issues, we decided to release this early. So technically, this was the first quest finished with the DOR tileset, but probably not the first DOR tileset quest to be released because of this. However, as a promotion for our upcoming Lost Isle in 2007, there is a hidden info guy in the quest that gives you tips not on Wolfstyle, but on Lost Isle! Just to inspire you!\nAs for the quest itself: It is a small quest with a 64 screen overworld only 7 main dungeons and a newly added Master Dome that wasn't present in the original. It is a completely remake of my very first quest the way it should have been. The overworld is expanded to fully realize the original vision and although the dungeons retain the same layout as the original, playing them is a whole different ballgame. \nThere is no special tricks or nothing fancy to interest those who are looking for something new in the ZC scene. It is simply a fun, short romp through quality Zelda that has the ability to be time-runned for those daring to make a time attack of it. \nFurthermore, I have fully implemented a difficulty setting in the quest itself! A normal mode for casual players and a hard mode for hardcore players. Don't complain about the absurdity of the challenge in hard mode, it was made for you to NOT win easily and it was made to be a bit cheap. But testers like Love for Fire and Ouch! have proven that hard mode can be beaten. If you can't take it, play normal mode like all the rest.\nChanges in hard mode: red potions are for sale instead of blue, the magic sword is for sale now and the master sword is now the prize of the Master Dome. The gold ring is now hidden somewhere.\nEnjoy!\n\nNOTE: USE BETA 183 TO PLAY THIS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUpdate 08 March 07: Made a few minor corrections in strings and edited a few graphical bugs out.\nUpdate 21 March 07: Made a major update so players wouldn't get stuck with lockblocks.",
    "story": "Basic story, collect 6 (!) triforce pieces this time and save Zelda from Ganon.\n\nHard Mode: The 6 triforce pieces aren't required in hard mode to access level 7, but you may still want to beat all 6 levels for all the tools and heart containers needed just to survive!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "The info guy hidden in the quest gives you pricey tips on special secrets found in the upcoming quest Lost Isle, not Wolfstyle DX. Just think of it as a teaser for Lost Isle and to give you a leg up on the quest when you finally do get your hands on it! \n\nVideo Walkthrough of Wolfstyle DX",

After his quest ended, Link was anxious to see the princess of his own land, so he quickly returned home. To his surprise, Zelda invited him to her zecret hideout, Zelda Falls, in the northwest corner of Hyrule. Link was only too happy to go, but he really should have brought more than Rupees and a shield; waiting for him was yet another adventure.\n\nUpon his arrival in Zelda Falls, Link walked through the waterfall to Zelda's cave. She presented him with a new wooden sword for his birthday. \"As if I don't already have a million of these,\" he thought to himself as he left.\n\nLess than a minute later, Link discovered a small underground palace. It was infested with enemies, but Link made short work of them. Strangely enough, Zelda was waiting for him in a room nearby. \"You have to help me Link!\" she told him. Apparently, Zelda's younger sister, Miriam, had recently gone missing. Link suspected Ganon at work, but Zelda insisted that she just wandered off. After they left the palace, Link and Zelda set out to find a young girl dear to them both...",

Overall, the game now plays even more like the original Zelda, to enhance your enjoyment of a considerable challenge.\n\nAs time has gone by, the BS tileset has evolved, and so has my quest design style. Having released the 1st and 2nd Quests unpassworded in the New BS tileset, I started to desire to remake my original ZC quest, \"Legend of Zelda: Master Quest,\" using the New BS tileset and a new way of doing things. \n\n\nNew improvements and additions include:\n\n- Completely redesigned BS Link sprites, modeled after the BS mascots and Classic Link (drawn by Dart Zaidyer and Radien).\n- Updated dungeons.\n- Truer classic-style gameplay.\n- Lowered frustration factor.\n- Redesigned level 9 featuring returning themes from 1st and 2nd Quest.\n- All known instances of the continue bug have been thwarted and eliminated.\n- Unpassworded quest file for enlightenment, amusement, and personalized play.\n- Updated companion FAQ helps you with stumper puzzles as much as ever.\n\n\nI've tested this quest extensively, and it should have fewer bugs than the original. However, beta testers were in short supply, so if you should come across ANY bug whatsoever, please tell me. I will do whatever necessary to fix the bug for you personally.",

Some of them are false walls.\n- If there are items you *know* you will need eventually, try to buy or find them as early as you can. MQ GREATLY rewards foresight.\n- Refer to the subscreen map often in dungeons. Mark unexplored areas, and remember where you need to go. Backtrack often!\n- If you're stuck, search the overworld for hint-giving old men.  In MQ they really are helpful!\n\nIf you need more help, check the FAQ included in the zip file for hint-a-licious assistance.\n\n\nAnd last but not least, if you want to cheat like crazy, open up the quest file in ZQuest and mess around to your hearts content. Since the quest is unpassworded, it uses the four standard cheat codes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. But remember, true Zelda gamers try to finish the game without cheats. ",

This is Legend of Zelda: Origin.\n\nDeveloper Description:\nDespite people commonly dismissing many remakes or revamps or in this case, re-envisioning of the original Zelda quests, this goes far beyond what you have ever seen for the 1st and 2nd quests. First off straight from the get-go you have a choice to either start the 1st or the 2nd quest in the same quest file. There is also an option for a 3rd xtreme quest after beating the second or straight from the get-go for those insane Gung-ho players. To top it off, you have selection of choice for which dungeons you want to play over the course of Xtreme 3rd. Three Quests in one, can you handle it?\nMassive changes with everything built from scratch. Heart containers on the overworld are now divided into 15 HC Pieces, the remaining 5 scattered across mini-games which you must win to acquire them. New secret locations, new cave systems, new dungeon layouts that do not conform to the original in anything but shape, every single item in ZC is utilized and can be acquired, a new Dome of Trials has opened up in the world, the ability to save Zelda in a variety of ways and finally a special bonus challenge for those who manage to complete Xtreme 3rd. This is everything you've been wanting to see for the originals, but never saw previously in any quest thus far.

Happy hunting.\n\nSuper bombs are not needed as often as with some of my other quests, but the price is the same. They can be found for free, but you'll have to buy them from time to time. Price is not high- 25 rupees each. Bomb shops are clearly marked and easy to find.\n\nThere are plenty of heart containers around. Everything burns, pushes, or bombs to open. Many screens offer a heart container piece, a few have heart containers. I didn't catalog all of these screens this time. But I don't think you'll have too much trouble collecting them. Triforce markings are on every screen that offers \"goodies.\"",

Taking 2 and a half years to construct this quest, expect to have anywhere from 15 to 30 or more hours of solid gameplay. The difficulty is not over-the-top, yet you'll encounter many interesting puzzles, many of which are totally new to Zelda. This quest includes almost every item; you'll find two in each of the quest's eight main dungeons and one in each mini-dungeon. You'll encounter Zelda's typical overworld areas, including a forest, lake, mountain, swamp, snowy mountain, and more. You can also amass a full 16-heart life gauge and a full 8-unit magic meter. Additionally, I've taken great care in making sure that grammar is perfect and that directions are as clear as possible.\n\nNote: I strongly suggest that you do not use a 2.5 beta to play this quest, as you will encounter several compatibility bugs that may inhibit you from completing the quest. Please use version 2.10. \n\nRegardless, I hope that you truly enjoy Link to the Heavens and that you have a load of fun. Many already have, so don't miss your chance.\n\nLast update: 9/15/09.

Tons of songs arranged from a variety of old games.The overworld should look a little familiar, I got the idea looking through the packaged booklets from my old Zelda cartridges. I made the game easy to moderate difficulty I guess, it's hard to tell. I also made an extremely thorough walk through for the quest, where you can choose to see limited information on where to go next, a detailed set of instructions for what to do, an item/HCP checklist with locations, and complete maps for every section of the game.

    "story": "Story, abridged version....Somewhere between Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on the timeline:Ganon appeared out of nowhere. He stole the triforce, but luckily the triforce of wisdom had been split up across the land to keep him from getting his hands on it. He waited for somebody else to do his work for him. Ganon attacked the newly built North Castle and took it for myself. Luckily, the King had not had a chance to move everything and make it his new home.The forces of Hyrule were divided, although most of them stood in the Great Palace, an old castle where the kings of Hyrule have ruled for generations. There was one village that had to actually move from their homes into the nearby mountains. A small entourage protects a young swordsman of the Link bloodline as he travels from the Great Palace to the hidden safety of New Kasuto, and was ambushed along the way. He finds himself unarmed at the entrance of a cave with enemies all around him.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- Each level has 2 items in it, plus a heart container and triforce piece.- Each minilevel has 1 item and a HCP for the boss (the first minilevel has a full heart container).- 4 of the optional dungeons have an item and HCP (the first has 2 of each actually)- 3 of the optional dungeons have a magic spell and a magic container.- Each town has a HCP within its boundaries, or in an area next to the town with no enemies at all.- Bombable rocks are all obvious in the overworld, most burnable bushes are too.- Your bombs and fire will not hurt you.- Getting lost in the Lost Woods is easy to do. Use the whistle to open a portal to the beginning.- When you die or quit, you start out with full health, which is great for dungeons.

I played through so many times I'm sick of looking at the quest.this is version 0.81BUG FIX: info shops used wrong stringsthis version 0.9FATAL BUG FIX: L9 1st Floor got stuck. I used an apparently-unintended exploit (the x makes it sound cool) of the room rules for it to work. When the bug was identified and removed in v2.5x, my exploit broke, and you couldn't get through the room. Running old zc v2.10, you are able to get through L9. It looks like this has been broken in 2.5x since at least 2016, but probably was somewhere in the beta before 2.5x's official release.bug fix: A locked door in L9 2nd Floor should have been 1-way instead of shutter on the other side. It acted as an unintended trap to make you repeat rooms, if you didn't have the magic key and if you took a particular route, although it was just an annoyance. Now the door is no longer a trap.bug fix: A re-enabling bubble was missing from the Secret Grave dungeon in the large graveyard.bug fix: Rocks were added north of North Castle to prevent somebody from getting stuck.rebalancing: Added re-enabling bubbles to a room next to the starting room of all dungeons/minidungeons that have permanently-disabling bubbles somewhere in them.rebalancing: Ruto magic game, the crazy impossible room has a second target you can hit and the timed warp has been removed.aesthetic: One overworld screen had a black square under the armos instead of the same tile as the ground.typo: Fixed the name of Midoro Palace on the dungeon map.typo: Fixed ending credits link to PureZC.",

Soshi's Quest has a complete 8X16 over world, two smaller mountain overworlds at each side of the main one, and 18 levels, 9 regular, 9 bonus.",
    "story": "Long ago, on a far away planet, there was a peaceful society called Soshi Valley, which was inhabited by lizard creatures called Soshis. Shunned by the other Soshis, was small group of them called Dark Soshis. They believed that without living beings, the universe was perfect, that life was a waste of space. And so they dedicated their lives to killing everything on the planet that breathed. After that had achieved this, they would use their dark powers to put an end to themselves, so the universe could thrive on its own, untouched by unnatural forces. But even they knew that they could never hope to accomplish this on their own, so they combined their powers and creating an all-powerful object called the Sludge Orb. Off of it spawned a giant creature made out of a poisonous slimy substance, and he was called king sludgious. However, he was defeated when one of the Soshi elders joined the Dark Soshis, learned their dark  magic, and used it to create what came to be called the Soshi Orb, which was then used to destroy the Sludge Orb. The elders knew that if the Soshi orb fell into the wrong hands, there would be no way to stop it. So they created seven trials, and hid pieces of the Soshi orb in each one. The eight piece rested in the home of the elders.\n\nMany years later, the Dark Soshis, although were beginning to abandon their quest for universe wide death, they still lived on in secrecy, completely unaware of what their ancestors had done, until they came across an ancient book, written by one of the Soshi elders of that time. These Dark Soshis were extremely full of them selves, and thought that the Sludgiens were only defeated the first time because they weren't god enough. So they revived the Skudge Orb, spawning a new, even more powerful than the first. However, it wasted most of its power into more sludgien troops, as he was very greedy, and the Dark soshis became his slaves. So the elders did what they always do in times of darkness. They looked to ancient prophesies for help. By doing this, they found that the only way to save Soshi Vally this time was to find \"the hero by the name of his own species\" and have him complete the seven trials created by the ancient elders, retrieve the seven Soshi Orbs hidden within them, find the eighth Soshi Orb, and us them to defeat King Sludgious II. So the elders called forth Soshi, the hero by the name of his own species, to save them from certain doom before it was too late!",

    "description": "Disclaimer: This quest features NSFW content not suitable for minors.\n\nThis story type DoR quest was started one and half a year ago, aiming to reach all players and fit in the Zelda timeline right after ALttP, but eventually I patched the quest with ideas from many games (mostly Ultima, Mega Man and Final Fantasy) and created an own story, the first episode of the Bloodline Saga.\n\nThe new thing is that the main character isn't Link, rather Knil and he has a girlfriend, Myra. You can explore two worlds with them, collecting three kind of main collectibles (Triforce piece aka Lightforce piece is just one of them). Also, Ganon is entirely out from the game, the head villain is Vaati.\n\nContents:\n-Altogether about 7 and a half size of mass overworlds\n-12 mandatory big dungeons\n-8 subdungeons\n-1 mandatory minidungeon\n-3 secret dungeons\n-1 small and 2 big sidequests\n-13 custom bosses not counting the final boss\n-3 main endings and some secret ones\n-ALL items used\n-some events/plot twists heavily directed towards affecting your emotions\n-many custom enemy and item tiles\n-cameos from games and from PureZC\n\nThe first overworld starts out as almost simple, then the complexity of lands and dungeons keep increasing til the last dungeons where I needed to use 5-7 DMaps for one floor. The difficulty is quite high, but you can use ZC player tricks at many places and you also can find HCPs and bomb upgrades fast. There are graphics from many different tilesets and sprite resources, including many custom (or mostly just edited) ones. Music is partially from VGmusic, but the official maestro was Nuvo.\n\nNote that Knil&Myra's first goal is to escape from Hyrule. As soon as they accomplish that, you shall never return to the Light World, not to the Hyrule as you knew it... so if you don't get an item in Hyrule, you never can go back to it. Considering things like that only the Light World has magic containers, we can say that how you play in the beginning determines what can you do... outside of... \"Hyrule\". Before and after that, pay attention to any clues and speak with all NPCs, because the road from one mandatory place to the next one isn't framed with airstation reflectors. I provide any help you need if you stuck, so relax.\n\nThe ZIP file contains no fly, but a ReadMe file that holds important and maybe interesting information, also a new SFX.dat file with sound effects specially for BB (mostly from ALttP). Move the original SFX.dat to a safe folder, before pasting BB's SFX.dat into your 2.10 folder.\n\nThis makes me remember, use ZC2.10.0 if you want to minimalize the amount of bugs, which is, hopefully, zero if you indeed use 2.10.\n\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.bbflashsite.co.nr made by Twilight_Knight\n\nMADE IN HUNGARY\n\nEnjoy! \n\nUpdate 1: [19. Nov. '08] Fixed many bugs, including the elimination of many blank warps. Improved design at 2 places. Improved credits. There's an urgent bugfix for ALL bosses, so download as soon as possible!\n\nUpdate 2: [22. Nov. '08] Fixed many smaller and huge bugs from beginning to last dungeon. Added Hungarian and Dutch ReadMe files!\n\nUpdate 3: [03. Dec. '08] Fixed many bugs, mostly involving warps. Added cheats, I hand them to those in need (permanently stuck or such).\n\nUpdate 4: [15.

Well, this quest is ALL ABOUT that. \n\n  Level 9 is available to you from the beginning. In fact, it's not even that far from where you start.

Well, assuming you have a sword and a bow, you can IN THEORY meet the Silver arrow on your way through and kill Ganon with just those. But you'll probably die instead. A lot. \n\n  So, here's the catch!! There are eight dungeons dedicated to eight items, plus a ton of stuff scattered around the overworld. If death just isn't you, you're gonna have to do some questing.  \n\n  The game also uses a system of statues. The Triforce doesn't play any real role in this quest, but as an item will allow you to whistle warp to these statues after you walk into them once. There are eight statues (duh) on the overworld, and if you die in an area of the overworld, you will be returned to this statue, instead of starting way back at the beginning. \n\n\n...oh, and Link talks. nyahahahaha     Also, You'll notice I have pink lava. It's mysterious!!!    AHAHAHAHAHA",
    "story": "Things have been quiet in the big cities and towns around Hyrule, and Ganon has been missing for a few months now. \n\n   Link and Zelda were about to do some work fixing up the kingdom when they received word from a sentry that several monsters were seen surrounding a castle, kinda in the middle of nowhere. Nobody seemed to care a whole lot, given that they didn't really bug people, but it didn't sit right at all with Link. or Zelda. \n\n   Zelda sent Link to the boring town to investigate. The town and the land surrounding it may be in the middle of nowhere, but there is a bright and colorful city located in the high mountains, quite away from it. It has some good supplies, but the little town has...       well, it has next to nothing. This is unfortunate, but Link must endeavor, and with no idea what Ganon is doing, he must Get in Level 9 and stop Ganon as quickly as he safely can, which may be a pretty long time.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Since you need it to kill Ganon anyways, I'll tell you that the bow dungeon is deep in the forest to the west of town. \n\n  Also, since the dungeons in this game do not have Triforce pieces as a goal, the compass markers are used for other things, like dungeon solutions, special item locations, etc. If a dungeon has you confused, LOOK FOR THE COMPASS!! IT'S YOUR KEY TO SUCCESS!",

    "description": "This is the full NES conversion of Ballad of a Bloodline (my biggest quest so far), which means not only using heavily modified LoZ tileset, but also converting everything to NES style and mechanics, like BB was made on the NES, in the 1980's. This means if you didn't play BB because you don't like big quests, you can play Bloodline Classic. The story is the same, just much more shortly explained.\n\nSome conversions:\n-all conversations are of one single string, with full capital letters\n-only official \"guys\" are used (Abei, Ama, etc.), no layered NPCs\n-all dungeons are one floor and never freeform\n-no one timed events\n-bosses are half-custom\n\nThere are many extras, too! You can learn the name of Hyrule's king, as well as explore Gerudo Desert, for example.\nSome BB cameos appear here, too. The music is usually different than in BB and is from the database.\n\nMADE IN HUNGARY\n\nEnjoy! \n\nUpdate 1: Plant Pond is now beatable. + small fixes\n\nUpdate 2: Big fixes + more money + cheaper masks",
    "story": "The dictature of Hyrule makes Knil and his girlfriend want to escape, but it's possible only with the Master Sword which requires 3 prized items. However, the real adventure begins after the escape...",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Secret items are rings, swords, lens of truth, nayru's love and boots.\nMaze routes are undocumented. Go left from first maze screen if you want to solve the maze, go down, right, up, right if you want to leave or find secrets.\nRemember, boomerangs (and sometimes sword) can remove blocks.\nLens of truth can't be found in Hyrule anymore.\nThere are comeback HCPs in all dungeons, except IW L4 and IW L8.",
