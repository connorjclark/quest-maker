He went back to Kakariko Village to recover using a potion. But his sword sits shining in the sun up on the mountain, and he had no way to get it down. After finding a wooden sword in a cave, he goes to see Zelda, where he learns that the strange events that are taking place have been happening because Ganon captured the Queen Fairy. Link must gather the key fragments which are scattered throughout Hyrule in order to form the Magic Key and unlock the door to Ganon's tower.",

It's recommended you play a few other quests to learn the feel of ZC before playing this quest, as it does assume you have experience.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">UPDATES:</strong><br> <br> The updated version is just named unification.qst in the zip file. But I'm also bundling the original non-modified release in here as unification-original.qst. Only play that version if you don't want any of the updates listed below. Both versions were still created in 1.90.<br> <br> UPDATE 1.0.2 (7/29/2014):<br> <br> 1. Hopefully fixed a dead end in level 8 that forced you to do a continue warp.<br> 2. Fixed a block \"puzzle\" in level 2 that would trap you in a block and force you to do a continue warp if you came into the room at the wrong direction.<br> 3. Hopefully fixed all instances where I used cancel warps so that later ZC versions don't randomly have wavy warps that go nowhere. If you still find some of these, please let me know.<br> <br> UPDATE 1.0.1 (7/24/2014):<br> <br> This is an extremely minor update that does 3 things.<br> <br> 1. Fixed the final boss. Yes, there was supposed to be a final boss. Boss flags and level numbers made him not appear. :(<br> 2. Significantly dulled the palettes of level 7, 8, and 9 (green and red). I have no idea how pre-teen me could handle staring at those palettes since they make me dizzy looking at them for a few minutes. The dull colors are by no means great, but I can at least look at them. <em class=\"bbc\">I have not updated the screenshots to reflect this change.</em><br> 3. Added an open door to the room that had a bunch of Pols Voice in level 3. I had never intended for the player to be forced to fight those with the wooden sword or even the level 2 sword and somehow legitimately thought you got the arrows before reaching them. This goes to show how awesome I was at not beta testing anything I made during this time period.<br> <br> You're maybe wondering why I'm not bothering to update more despite fixing these issues. Truth be told, I want to keep this up as it is mostly as a record of what I did with my first (and still currently only at the time of writing this) released quest. Doing any major changes to it would ruin that. Of course I'm fully aware that modern ZC players that stumble on this update might play the quest and go \"what is this crap!?\" because of many of my more questionable design decisions (and believe me, there are plenty of them), but that's totally fair since standards change and this was honestly kind of average at most even for the time in my opinion. My own standards have changed since making this and I feel that I've grown as a quest maker since then.<br> <br> Still, there were people that had fun playing it and I admit I have fun going back and playing it every so often even if I cringe at some of the things I did. So that's why I decided to go through with submitting this update to fix these issues that have irked me for years.<br> <br> Also, if there are any other bugs, feel free to mention them and I'll try to fix them if I can. Keep in mind that I'm using 1.90 and DOSBox is a huge pain to operate, so I may not get to everything.",

The mist in the room causes Link to pass out! He wakes up to find himself on an island shoreline. Wrote in the sand near the water is:<br><br>\"Welcome to Dragon Island, the island out of normal human reach!\"<br><br>The tide comes in and covers the message.

I decided to give the quest to JayeM, because I know how much life she'd be able to breathe into it...<br> <br> That was a few months ago... two I think... and she's done extraordinarily well with it... adding almost all of the new features from the new beta, developing the remaining dungeons that needed to be finished, as well as expand on the overworld a bit and add new sub levels... <br> <br> Now the time has come for her to need a beta tester, and I'm doing it myself. Bigjoe has also been beta testing, and has done a terrific job. He also helped out by adding new BS Enemies created by VEL. Special thanks to him.<br> <br> Anyways, I am truly amazed at how solid a quest this really is. I'm proud to have worked on it for so long, and I'm proud to have JayeM as it's other parent. I hope you'll all enjoy this quest as much as I do.",

    "storyHtml": "After Link saved Hyrule from the evil grasp of Ganon the kingdom of Hyrule prospered as a major center of trade. Three other kingdoms called Tenn, Montar, and Frellan arose around Hyrule, as a result of its expansion. Link put his weapons in the royal armory, because he had no need for them any longer, and the Triforce was placed in the throne room and heavily guarded. Link moved to the kingdom of Tenn and began to raise a family. But one fateful day Link was killed by a group of angry moblins; not even his great skill could save him. For over 10 years Hyrule reigned as the largest kingdom in the world, but the remaining band of Ganon's army sought tirelessly to revive their once great leader. After 11 long years they finally suceeded. Ganon easily retook the Triforce in the absense of Link and brought Hyrule to its knees. 9 years later Ganon grew angry because even though he destroyed Hyrule, the three daughter kingdoms still prospered, so he sought to capture and destroy them as well. He began by kidnapping the princess Julie of Frellan. Then Ganon created strong-holds (in each Ganon put Link's weapons to keep them from any adventurous soul) in each of the kingdoms and sent his armies out to destroy the land. Now it is up to Link's son, also named Link, to gather his father's weapons and destroy Ganon in the Dead Land.",

With the ground thoroughly searched, you realize you will have to use the lessons of your dreams in real life and use your waking experience in lucid dreams, if you are to secure the units necessary to find the Gameboy and \"What's-Her-Name?\"<br><br>...And so much more, like some deal about an \"Octoforce\" or something. You can't be expected to know how everything works, can you?",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "Almost all of the overworld screens have an item and a cave/warp, so be VERY thorough in your explorations. Be careful with limited items, as they are, well, limited. There are no cheat codes for this game. If someone is inspired to add/change/export content I may release to them the edit code upon receipt of a detailed request.

    "descriptionHtml": "It borrows from the Wind Waker concept of a world with a big ocean; with islands dotting the landscape. Well since ZC is on a screen by screen basis, screens of just simply water would be boring as hell to travel through. So except in certain cases, there will be land in almost every screen on the massive 16x16 overworld. So its like Wind Waker, but the island are more jam-packed together. This prevents long sailing times on the raft and later, long swim times with the flippers. So I hope this speeds things up a bit.<br> Anyway, there will be some story in the form of Aryll, your sister and townspeople in your home town, Goron City and Zora Cave. After levels 1, 7 and 8, you can return to these towns and get new information out of them and get a new item from Aryll.<br> Now the game starts off on your home island and you MUST complete level 1 and then visit Aryll to get the raft so you can get off your island and explore the ocean. Now from here on in, you have FREE exploration through almost ALL the islands and areas of the huge overworld. You can tackle levels 2-7 in ANY order you choose. With the small exception of gaining flippers from level 5 to access level 6. Other than that, you are free to go and do what you want and where you want. Just note that the further dungeons you skip to, the harder it will be on you since you may have fewer hearts early in the game. <br> Now as for secrets, here is a list:<br> - 2 HC Pieces on each major island<br> - 4 HC Pieces in 4 separate mini-dungeons found underwater in the vast ocean<br> - 6 Magic upgrades on 6 minor islands<br> - 8 Bomb upgrades on 8 major islands<br> - 3 Extra required dungeons including the new optional Master Dome<br> - Tons and Tons of rupees found on land, underwater, or found by defeating all enemies on certain overworld screens.<br> Enjoy!<br> <br> Please Use beta 183 to play this!!!!!!!!!!!<br> <br> Ver. 1.3 - Added more raft paths to make the overworld a bit more accessible. Added some more free super bombs due to complaints of players. Decreased the price on super bombs and magic shields in shops around the overworld. Should play smoother now.<br> Ver. 1.4 - Added a new mini-dungeon and added another raft path. Fixed some more bugs and finished up with the suggestions made from the forums.<br> Ver. 1.5 - Fixed a potion shop in the 'dead town' so those player with no potions leftover from level 8 can have some relief.<br> Latest Update: 6/12/2006 - Tried to squash as many Level A, B, C continue bugs as possible, even to the point that you can no longer start in those dungeons anymore. I hope the problem is fixed now. Also made general detail touch ups across the board.<br> Update: Replaced the missing readme file mentioned in this description!",

    "descriptionHtml": "(This quest was created by Phantom Menace and completed by Nightmare...)<br><br>Back in 1999, Phantom Menace and I were working together on Zelda Classic (pretty much just us), and we made two separate quests. One was New Quest (mine) as everyone knows, the other was the Demo Quest, supposedly the try-out field for new features BEYOND Zelda Classic. As you know, New Quest was honored and remembered.<br><br>Sadly, for our creator of Zelda Classic, Demo Quest never got finished as PM got sidetracked.<br><br>So in the summer of 2004, five years later, I asked for permission to finish off Demo Quest to satisfy the urges of the oldbies wanting to save Zelda in that quest, as well as make it playable (if you thought James Quest 2 or Mega Man: DWR DC were hard, pick up Demo Quest from the AGN DB. Makes both of those look easy!) I was successful in updating and adding a lot of ZC's new features and tricks into Demo to re-create the feel it had back in 1999, with new features as well. It's also MUCH more playable now. Unfortunately, much as I love his work, PM tended to be a much better Zelda player than me and his quests were designed that way. Everyone should have a chance now rather than just 3-4 players.<br><br>Updated 02/09/05 to fix bug in Level 4.<br>Updated April 2015 to version 2.50.<br><br>Patch 3 Notes 5/31/2017<br><br>1.

MOLKA!!<br> <br> ***Updated 8/14/07*** Fixed some long-outstanding bugs, such as not being able to exit from a later dungeon until you've beaten it (and that dungeon required Bait too, so O_o on that), various Continue bugs (though they're not eliminated, they are now no longer game-stopping) and I also removed the things the Bosses say to you when you fight them 'cause Link can't move and the Boss often can get in a free hit. Not cool. Lastly, I added 4 new screenshots. <span rel=\"lightbox\">:D</span>",
    "storyHtml": "Molka is a mountain land, inhabited by strong, hearty folks. This land was peaceful enough, as Ganon had never touched the place. Well, THAT'S because Ganon did NOT know that Molka had a triforce of it's own! The Triforce of Gizmos allowed it's owner mastery over his or her items. Link could've used something like this in his first adventure, couldn't he? Well, also in Molka were new items that Link or anyone in Hyrule had never heard of before. The Whistle of the Winds was an example.<br> <br> Ganon always seems to revive himself after being defeated, huh? It's true. Link and Ganon have faced off so many times it's not even funny. (That's thanks to anyone who's ever made a Zelda Classic Quest!) So, Ganon revives himself again and goes at it, thinking of another way to defeat Link. After 3 days of thinking, Ganon bolts out of his chair and yells, \"I HAVE IT! I know how to defeat Link! I just have to kidnap Zelda to a land with tougher enemies!\" All his minions applauded. What a plan! It was brilliant!<br> <br> Ganon sent out scouts to find a land with really hard enemies. They found one: Molka. \"Great job, boys!\" Ganon said to the scouts. \"Let's prepare to strike!\" And with that, Ganon and his minions started building the Dark Base, a floating dungeon that could travel anywhere. In 2 weeks, it was finished. Ganon took Zelda the next night, as she was walking out on her balcony to gaze at the stars, and transported her up into the Dark Base. Then they flew to the mountain of Molka, putting Ganon's plan fully in action. Ganon just had to wait for Link.<br> <br> The Hyrulians didn't panic. This has happened before. Zelda's been kidnapped a lot, so they knew the drill. Rebuild the Triforce, send Link to Level 9, defeat Ganon. Right? Well, that's when the Hyrulian messenger reported that Ganon escaped to Molka. OOPS, this ain't part o' the drill! NOW they panicked. But Link didn't. Already he was thinking of a way to get to Molka.<br> <br> He went home that night with no plan. His sidekick, a Wind Wizzrobe (who he met secretly in A Link to the Past), tried to cheer him up a bit. He knew how to play Link's whistle better than Link, so he played a song for him. Link didn't cheer up. \"I've been on many adventures before, but Molka... I don't even know where Molka is!\" The Wizzrobe stopped playing and looked at Link, hard. \"Did you say, MOLKA?\" Silence. \"Link, I lived in Molka during your first adventure! I know where it is!\"<br> <br> By the next day, Link was prepared to go. The laws of Molka stated that most Hyrulian items were not allowed within the land. So, Link was bringing his Boomerang, Wooden Sword, and a Blue Potion with him. Even the Red Ring stayed behind. Once he was all ready, the Wind Wizzrobe blew him in a tornado to the city in Molka. It worked!<br> <br> Now, Link knew where he had to go. The Triforce of Gizmos, still undetected by Ganon, was hid away hundreds of years ago in 8 pieces, each piece inside one of the dangerous Forts of Molka. These Forts also contained legendary Molkian items (like the Whistle of the Winds), allowing Link even more power. Only once Link had completely mastered his items would he be able to reach the Dark Base floating over the northeastern corner of Molka. And the best part is, Ganon doesn't even know Link is prepared so well. He doesn't know what he's askin' for!!!",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "-Molka's Forts are chalk full of secret passages. Try getting the Map as soon as possible so you can find these passages better. Even without the Map, once you've gotten far enough in the Quest, you'll just know where things are.<br> <br> -Ganon's right about tougher enemies. In the later levels, you may be fighting a whole room of Blue Darknuts, or even 4 Manhandlas! There are Potion shops about, MAKE GOOD USE OF 'EM.<br> <br> -Statues are everywhere on the mountain. Use an item on them that they relate to, to clear a path. Memorize the paths on this mountain, learn 'em well. As you collect items from the Forts, you'll definitely need to move backward in order to move forward.<br> <br> -You can carry a maximum of 20 Bombs, once you find the shops. Some items are extremely rare and not required to win. The Magic Key can be bought for 980 Rupees. See, you weren't meant to have it! Try the Gold Ring instead. It's only about 700 Rupees. <span rel=\"lightbox\">;)</span><br> <br> -Like I said above, I made a \"workaround\" for the continue bug if you're using 2.10 instead of 1.92, but this still starts you out in the Boss Room. If you want to stop fighting the Boss over and over and get a potion or whatever, you still have to Quit-&gt;Save. It's the best I could manage to be compatible with both 1.92b and 2.10. Nothing major though.",

    "storyHtml": "Princess Zelda knew that she didn't have much time until evil returned to the land of Hyrule. She decided to head out to a remote island, far from Hyrule, where she could safely hide the Triforce of Wisdom from the clutches of evil. She told no one of her plans except for her noble aid, Impa. As Zelda was trying to hide the last four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom on the island, she was captured by a renegade group of Moblins in the forest. The Moblin tribe was attempting to create an entrance to the Dark World so they could once again be together with their master, Ganon. The Moblins were successful and were able to open a path to the Dark World and turned Zelda over to Ganon. Ganon knew that it wouldn't be long before Link learned of Zelda's fate, so he scattered the other four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom throughout the Dark World. Ganon then commanded the rest of his minions find the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom Zelda hid so that he could claim them as his own. Back in Hyrule, there was much concern when the princess was reported as missing for a long period of time. Impa then decided to seek help with Link, the Hero of Time. When Link learned of Zelda's capture, he immediately set out to rescue her from Ganon's clutches. On the way to the island, his ship was damaged in a storm and he lost all his possessions, becoming shipwrecked on the island. Starting his adventure without even having his trusty sword at his side, Link must find a way to navigate this new island to find the princess and rescue her from Ganon.",

It consists of Samus traveling to a series of different planets on her quest to catch Ridley. The dungeons start out easy, but get a little harder toward the end. At the very end, I decided that the very last dungeon (with Fett) was a little hard, so I provided a way to view a fast ending in case you don’t want to play all the way through the last dungeon. But if you do stick with it and beat the entire game, you get a much more rewarding ending. The storyline may seem a little similar to Meitroid Prime: Hunters, because it’s about Samus battle other bounty hunters, but I actually finished this quest many years before the DS ever came out. I'm only just now getting around to redoing some tiles and uploading it.",

    "storyHtml": "This chapter is sort of an adaptation of many of the LOZ stories. It begins where Link just beat Ganon to save Zelda. However, just because Ganon was defeated and encapsulated in stone doesn't mean that Ganon's minions are gone. On the way back to Hyrule Castle, Link was mobbed by a massive amount of darknuts. Unfortunately, the darknuts overwhelmed Link, and took all of his goods and Zelda. Now Link must save Zelda wherever she is. Link also recalls that Zelda told him of a 'blue Triforce' that, when combined, would let the worthy claim the true Triforces of Power, Courage, and Wisdom. Now Link must set off to save Zelda and claim the 'blue Triforce'.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "Tip 1: Don't get frustrated. This quest is not designed to be completed in five minutes. In fact the fastest run I made wasn't less than 10 hours. It is also designed to be tough, but not too tough. So if you are dying consistently, then either you need more hearts or better equipment. Tip 2: Explore everywhere! HCP's are direly needed in the quest as you don't get Heart Containers. The problem is that I counted the number of HCP's and the count comes out different each time. (it is between 81-84 but it really doesn't matter, you'll see why toward the end of the game.) So keep playing. Tip 3: PAY FOR THE HINTS!!! This will REALLY help your progression in the quest. Also, for those who can't get through, I will be making a walkthrough on a site here in the not so distant future, so keep your eyes open. If you have any questions, post them and I will see how to answer them to the best of my ability.<br> www.geocities.com/darthpikachu21/Level1.html",

ETC. ETC. <br> <br> Story:<br> the story starts out as most of wario's bussness ventures do. one day he's laying on the couch and he sees an advertisement on TV. \"NEW! FROM GAMECO! the massivly multiplayer online RPG smash hit that everyone's talking about! WORLD OF EVERLIFE 2! play with people from around the globe! incredibly addicting! only $50 and an additonal $15 a month!\" <br> so then the microscopic peanut that is wario's brain acheves the following train of thought; \"hey! if I make an addictive-a smash hit thingey, mabey I can-a charge ridiculous amounts of a-money! and the best part is that they'll-a PAY MY HUGE FEES NO MATTER WHAT! but who should I a-chose to be in charge of the project, hmmm... Mona has a job at that pizza place, Jimmy likes go a-goof of and a-dance insted of a-work, Dribble is too big, Spitz is-a to short, orblon only has-a 3 fingers, Dr. Crygor is to-a... err... never mind him, Wait! I have it! I'll get 9-volt to a-do it! he a-loves nintendo games-a so much he cant say no to me! unless Mario (blech!) a-tells him not-a to. but what are the odds of-a that? mwa ha ha! I'm so smart!\" <br> just as wario expected, 9-Volt agreed to make the game so 9-Volt got a new computer with a 999 Gigahertz pressesor,a 500 gigabyte hard drive, and a neat-o USB controller. a few weeks later, the game was open for a private Gamma test (a gamma test is like a beta test only more so) and 9-volt just finished tranfering his entire NES game collection to the hard drive of the computer when 9-volt, to his horror acidently hit the \"transfer all dowloaded data to game and scatter about in the form of the Triforce\" button (who's Idea was to put a button that did that?) so 9-volt went and played the game to find all 8 peces of the triforce, and at the same time stop the illigal hacking going on in the game. <br> 9-volt thought \"let's start in hyrule....",

Now the Triforce Pieces are guraded by Ganon's greatest warriors and Link must find somehow to get through the several dungeons of Snortsia and claim the pieces.

    "storyHtml": "On a small island just outside of Hyrule lived a boy named Link. As he grew up, he knew he was destined to become the new Hero of Hyrule. The Robins who were neighbors of Link, told him that the bloodline of the Hero’s past through him. He knew that on any given day his adventure could begin.<br><br>One day Link was drawing a picture of a sword on the mountainside of the island. He looked down at his shield that he always kept with him, and thought how cool it would be to finally use it with a sword of his own. Just then his good friend Patty walked over to him. She looked a little sad, as she told him that she was going to leave the island soon in search for the Shooting Star Legend. In that moment, they both looked at the shoreline and noticed that the water was acting very violent. But they brushed it off. As Link finished the drawing, he signed his name on the bottom of the sword. Patty was still talking about that legend; however, Link couldn’t keep his eyes off the coastline, which was getting worse by the second.<br><br>Little did they know, the Dark Army had just docked south of the city of Fulton. The Commander of the Army stepped out to dock while discussing the plan to this staff, “Continue searching for the remaining Triforce pieces. We will capture Fulton and await you there!” As the Commander looked at the path to Fulton, he whispered to himself, “And now it begins.”",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "First of all don’t use any cheats on this game because of the amount of events I put in this game. Second this game is huge. Expect 15-25 hours on this game. If you don’t like huge games I say pass it up. Third, the game does get a little hard. I suggest you getting POTIONS whenever possible. You are going to die quite a bit, but don’t worry you will end up passing it. If you have any questions ask in the forum and I will help you out. Also make sure to read the story because they give you a lot of hints for things you need to do.<br> <br> Also here is a link to my Director's Commentary on my game.

Here is a hint to get the legendary items in an unmapped room. Level 4, while you are about to ride the first minecart, walk-through wall is above. Go through it and you can get the Farore's Wind. Level 5, after you rode the minecart, behind the pots is a walk-through wall. Get the Nayru's love. Level 6, in a room where there is just a rectangular lava, the right side is bombable. <br> Enter through it and get the magic key. Don't leave the room yet, the right wall is a walk-through to get Din's fire. The legendary items are as the items from SNES A link to the past. Bombos medallion is Din's fire, Ether medallion is Nayru's love and quake medallion is Farore's wind.<br> <br> There are unmapped rooms in all dungeons where there is 10 rupies. Accessed by blowing a hole in the wall by a bomb.<br> <br> Link's bed at Link's house is also a life restoring room. Walk to the far right side of the bed to restore Life energy.<br> <br> Be sure to buy the arrows at the village before going to the level 2 dungeon. Also you may need to buy an extra key before going in dungeon levels 2, 3, 5 and 6 (even 7 but if you've found the magic key in 6, you don't have to worry).

    "descriptionHtml": "This quest was made, completed and finished within 3 months about 8 months ago. (about March or April of this year) But it was delayed in release because Petoe and I wanted it to be a simultaneous release with Lost Isle. But since Lost Isle is being delayed for a while due to quality assurance and other issues, we decided to release this early. So technically, this was the first quest finished with the DOR tileset, but probably not the first DOR tileset quest to be released because of this. However, as a promotion for our upcoming Lost Isle in 2007, there is a hidden info guy in the quest that gives you tips not on Wolfstyle, but on Lost Isle! Just to inspire you!<br> As for the quest itself: It is a small quest with a 64 screen overworld only 7 main dungeons and a newly added Master Dome that wasn't present in the original. It is a completely remake of my very first quest the way it should have been. The overworld is expanded to fully realize the original vision and although the dungeons retain the same layout as the original, playing them is a whole different ballgame. <br> There is no special tricks or nothing fancy to interest those who are looking for something new in the ZC scene. It is simply a fun, short romp through quality Zelda that has the ability to be time-runned for those daring to make a time attack of it. <br> Furthermore, I have fully implemented a difficulty setting in the quest itself! A normal mode for casual players and a hard mode for hardcore players. Don't complain about the absurdity of the challenge in hard mode, it was made for you to NOT win easily and it was made to be a bit cheap. But testers like Love for Fire and Ouch! have proven that hard mode can be beaten. If you can't take it, play normal mode like all the rest.<br> Changes in hard mode: red potions are for sale instead of blue, the magic sword is for sale now and the master sword is now the prize of the Master Dome. The gold ring is now hidden somewhere.<br> Enjoy!<br> <br> NOTE: USE BETA 183 TO PLAY THIS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!<br> <br> Update 08 March 07: Made a few minor corrections in strings and edited a few graphical bugs out.<br> Update 21 March 07: Made a major update so players wouldn't get stuck with lockblocks.",
    "storyHtml": "Basic story, collect 6 (!) triforce pieces this time and save Zelda from Ganon.<br> <br> Hard Mode: The 6 triforce pieces aren't required in hard mode to access level 7, but you may still want to beat all 6 levels for all the tools and heart containers needed just to survive!",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "The info guy hidden in the quest gives you pricey tips on special secrets found in the upcoming quest Lost Isle, not Wolfstyle DX. Just think of it as a teaser for Lost Isle and to give you a leg up on the quest when you finally do get your hands on it! <span rel=\"lightbox\">;)</span><br> <br> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/Darkflamewolf#...7AB9BCCFCE02DC6\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">Video Walkthrough of Wolfstyle DX</a>",

After his quest ended, Link was anxious to see the princess of his own land, so he quickly returned home. To his surprise, Zelda invited him to her zecret hideout, Zelda Falls, in the northwest corner of Hyrule. Link was only too happy to go, but he really should have brought more than Rupees and a shield; waiting for him was yet another adventure.<br> <br> Upon his arrival in Zelda Falls, Link walked through the waterfall to Zelda's cave. She presented him with a new wooden sword for his birthday. \"As if I don't already have a million of these,\" he thought to himself as he left.<br> <br> Less than a minute later, Link discovered a small underground palace. It was infested with enemies, but Link made short work of them. Strangely enough, Zelda was waiting for him in a room nearby. \"You have to help me Link!\" she told him. Apparently, Zelda's younger sister, Miriam, had recently gone missing. Link suspected Ganon at work, but Zelda insisted that she just wandered off. After they left the palace, Link and Zelda set out to find a young girl dear to them both...",

First off straight from the get-go you have a choice to either start the 1st or the 2nd quest in the same quest file. There is also an option for a 3rd xtreme quest after beating the second or straight from the get-go for those insane Gung-ho players. To top it off, you have selection of choice for which dungeons you want to play over the course of Xtreme 3rd. Three Quests in one, can you handle it?<br> Massive changes with everything built from scratch. Heart containers on the overworld are now divided into 15 HC Pieces, the remaining 5 scattered across mini-games which you must win to acquire them. New secret locations, new cave systems, new dungeon layouts that do not conform to the original in anything but shape, every single item in ZC is utilized and can be acquired, a new Dome of Trials has opened up in the world, the ability to save Zelda in a variety of ways and finally a special bonus challenge for those who manage to complete Xtreme 3rd.

The difficulty is not over-the-top, yet you'll encounter many interesting puzzles, many of which are totally new to Zelda. This quest includes almost every item; you'll find two in each of the quest's eight main dungeons and one in each mini-dungeon. You'll encounter Zelda's typical overworld areas, including a forest, lake, mountain, swamp, snowy mountain, and more. You can also amass a full 16-heart life gauge and a full 8-unit magic meter. Additionally, I've taken great care in making sure that grammar is perfect and that directions are as clear as possible.<br> <br> Note: I strongly suggest that you do not use a 2.5 beta to play this quest, as you will encounter several compatibility bugs that may inhibit you from completing the quest.

    "storyHtml": "Story, abridged version....<br>Somewhere between Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on the timeline:<br>Ganon appeared out of nowhere. He stole the triforce, but luckily the triforce of wisdom had been split up across the land to keep him from getting his hands on it. He waited for somebody else to do his work for him. Ganon attacked the newly built North Castle and took it for myself. Luckily, the King had not had a chance to move everything and make it his new home.<br>The forces of Hyrule were divided, although most of them stood in the Great Palace, an old castle where the kings of Hyrule have ruled for generations. There was one village that had to actually move from their homes into the nearby mountains. A small entourage protects a young swordsman of the Link bloodline as he travels from the Great Palace to the hidden safety of New Kasuto, and was ambushed along the way. He finds himself unarmed at the entrance of a cave with enemies all around him.",

Use the whistle to open a portal to the beginning.<br>- When you die or quit, you start out with full health, which is great for dungeons. Do you need to get back to one of the rooms near the entrance, but don't want to go through all those rooms to get back? There's no downside to strategically quitting and continuing (unless you're trying to collect rupees or refill bombs along the way back).<br>- Walkthrough.... I can't make it any easier than that.",

When the bug was identified and removed in v2.5x, my exploit broke, and you couldn't get through the room. Running old zc v2.10, you are able to get through L9. It looks like this has been broken in 2.5x since at least 2016, but probably was somewhere in the beta before 2.5x's official release.<br>bug fix: A locked door in L9 2nd Floor should have been 1-way instead of shutter on the other side. It acted as an unintended trap to make you repeat rooms, if you didn't have the magic key and if you took a particular route, although it was just an annoyance.

    "storyHtml": "Long ago, on a far away planet, there was a peaceful society called Soshi Valley, which was inhabited by lizard creatures called Soshis. Shunned by the other Soshis, was small group of them called Dark Soshis. They believed that without living beings, the universe was perfect, that life was a waste of space. And so they dedicated their lives to killing everything on the planet that breathed. After that had achieved this, they would use their dark powers to put an end to themselves, so the universe could thrive on its own, untouched by unnatural forces. But even they knew that they could never hope to accomplish this on their own, so they combined their powers and creating an all-powerful object called the Sludge Orb. Off of it spawned a giant creature made out of a poisonous slimy substance, and he was called king sludgious. However, he was defeated when one of the Soshi elders joined the Dark Soshis, learned their dark magic, and used it to create what came to be called the Soshi Orb, which was then used to destroy the Sludge Orb. The elders knew that if the Soshi orb fell into the wrong hands, there would be no way to stop it. So they created seven trials, and hid pieces of the Soshi orb in each one. The eight piece rested in the home of the elders.<br> <br> Many years later, the Dark Soshis, although were beginning to abandon their quest for universe wide death, they still lived on in secrecy, completely unaware of what their ancestors had done, until they came across an ancient book, written by one of the Soshi elders of that time. These Dark Soshis were extremely full of them selves, and thought that the Sludgiens were only defeated the first time because they weren't god enough. So they revived the Skudge Orb, spawning a new, even more powerful than the first. However, it wasted most of its power into more sludgien troops, as he was very greedy, and the Dark soshis became his slaves. So the elders did what they always do in times of darkness. They looked to ancient prophesies for help. By doing this, they found that the only way to save Soshi Vally this time was to find \"the hero by the name of his own species\" and have him complete the seven trials created by the ancient elders, retrieve the seven Soshi Orbs hidden within them, find the eighth Soshi Orb, and us them to defeat King Sludgious II. So the elders called forth Soshi, the hero by the name of his own species, to save them from certain doom before it was too late!",

The difficulty is quite high, but you can use ZC player tricks at many places and you also can find HCPs and bomb upgrades fast.

As soon as they accomplish that, you shall never return to the Light World, not to the Hyrule as you knew it... so if you don't get an item in Hyrule, you never can go back to it. Considering things like that only the Light World has magic containers, we can say that how you play in the beginning determines what can you do... outside of... \"Hyrule\". Before and after that, pay attention to any clues and speak with all NPCs, because the road from one mandatory place to the next one isn't framed with airstation reflectors. I provide any help you need if you stuck, so relax.<br> <br> The ZIP file contains no fly, but a ReadMe file that holds important and maybe interesting information, also a new SFX.dat file with sound effects specially for BB (mostly from ALttP). Move the original SFX.dat to a safe folder, before pasting BB's SFX.dat into your 2.10 folder.<br> <br> This makes me remember, use ZC2.10.0 if you want to minimalize the amount of bugs, which is, hopefully, zero if you indeed use 2.10.<br> <br> For more information, please visit<br> www.bbflashsite.co.nr made by Twilight_Knight<br> <br> MADE IN HUNGARY<br> <br> Enjoy! :D<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">Update 1: [19.

Well, this quest is ALL ABOUT that. <br> <br> Level 9 is available to you from the beginning. In fact, it's not even that far from where you start. However, Level 9 is still Level 9, and still as hellish as ever (And also twice as big!!) It's essentially a long road of endurance. <br> <br> So you can go in Level 9. But can you beat it? Well, assuming you have a sword and a bow, you can IN THEORY meet the Silver arrow on your way through and kill Ganon with just those. But you'll probably die instead. A lot. <br> <br> So, here's the catch!! There are eight dungeons dedicated to eight items, plus a ton of stuff scattered around the overworld. If death just isn't you, you're gonna have to do some questing. <br> <br> The game also uses a system of statues. The Triforce doesn't play any real role in this quest, but as an item will allow you to whistle warp to these statues after you walk into them once. There are eight statues (duh) on the overworld, and if you die in an area of the overworld, you will be returned to this statue, instead of starting way back at the beginning. <br> <br> <br> ...oh, and Link talks. nyahahahaha Also, You'll notice I have pink lava. It's mysterious!!! AHAHAHAHAHA",

Nobody seemed to care a whole lot, given that they didn't really bug people, but it didn't sit right at all with Link. or Zelda. <br> <br> Zelda sent Link to the boring town to investigate. The town and the land surrounding it may be in the middle of nowhere, but there is a bright and colorful city located in the high mountains, quite away from it. It has some good supplies, but the little town has... well, it has next to nothing. This is unfortunate, but Link must endeavor, and with no idea what Ganon is doing, he must Get in Level 9 and stop Ganon as quickly as he safely can, which may be a pretty long time.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "Since you need it to kill Ganon anyways, I'll tell you that the bow dungeon is deep in the forest to the west of town. <br> <br> Also, since the dungeons in this game do not have Triforce pieces as a goal, the compass markers are used for other things, like dungeon solutions, special item locations, etc. If a dungeon has you confused, LOOK FOR THE COMPASS!!

It features all of the following:<br> <br> * 9 Complete Levels, each with a distinct theme - some standard dungeon, some sidescrolling, and some \"other\"<br> * Cutscenes to progress the plot - they don't appear until after Level 6, but there are several of them at the end<br> * Connectivity with the first Bikdip's Adventure<br> * A noteworthy plot with several twists along the way <br> * A Bonus Level that you can unlock on the title screen<br> * Lots of hidden secrets<br> * And it was (mostly) made in the primitive ZC 1.90! I made the decision early on to make the quest in 1.90 because I wanted to prove that even with old software, games can still be made interesting and fun to play. It's just like how the original Zelda (and other NES games) could be great even with limited technology. However, due to technical difficulties, the quest had to be split into two segments. After beating the first, you will find a url that tells you where to get the second. The second part is to be played in 1.92 b 183 if possible.<br> <br> Please don't judge the whole quest by the beginning. It was made three years ago and may not feature all the interesting tricks and such that are in the later parts of the quest. That is not to say it starts out badly, or boring, but keep in mind it gets better. Also refrain from rating the quest until you get through most or all of it, and don't rate it a 0 because you hated a certain, small part of it. That isn't fair.<br> <br> This quest is best played in 1.90. I strongly suggest you play it with that version unless your computer absolutely cannot run it. If that is the case, 1.92 is bearable. 2.10 is completely out of the question. You will encounter SEVERE bugs if you use 2.10. For later beta and alpha versions, use them at your own risk - I have not tested any.<br> <br> A lengthy readme included in the download should answer most of your questions. I suggest that you read it, or at least skim through most of it. If you want specific information about how the different ZC versions run the quest, need help with a level or the game in general, want to know where an item is, or just read about the quest's history, the readme is your friend.<br> <br> The contents of the ZIP file are as follows:<br> * BA2_EB.qst - the quest itself<br> * BA2.sav - a .sav file with BA1 beaten for those who didn't / don't want to play that quest. Rename your current SAV file to something else, then rename this one \"zelda.sav\" to use it without overwriting your old one.<br> * The readme file - should be viewed in Notepad.",
    "storyHtml": "The main character of this game is named Bargo, and he is a Bikdip, which is basically a three-eyed happy face.<br> <br> Before the first Bikdip's Adventure, he was on a journey with some other Strange Creatures when he suddenly appeared in this new world. He had no idea what was going on other than a few strange thoughts he suddenly had. \"Collect the Triforce Pieces ... Save Zelda ... Defeat Ganon...\" He didn't know what any of this meant, but he traveled through the world, solving puzzles and killing monsters, completing all three of those things. This world was at peace and he could return home, right?<br> <br> Wrong. Ganon had miraculously managed to survive. He used the last of his power to knock out Bargo, freeze Zelda to the spot, and scatter the pieces of the Triforce once again. Completely weakened, he stole all of Bargo's possessions and went into hiding.<br> <br> Bargo awoke, still next to Zelda at the end of the final dungeon. He knows that if he ever wants to get home, he has to revive Zelda. So now his quest picks up where it left off, and he must find all the Triforce Pieces again and defeat Ganon for good.<br> <br> Following Level 6, you will view a cutscene that unveils Ganon's schemes. He is slowly making a triumphant return, and a new villain is introduced. Your overall goal in the quest will be quite different from then on. From there, the plot advances even further, most notably in the last level. You'll have to play the quest to find out what happens.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "The readme covers this pretty well. Please consult it for tips and hints.<br> <br> There is a Level 1 Cheat hidden in the quest. If you find it, you can use it in the last level or throughout the whole quest if you ever play it again.<br> <br> There is also a complex series of secrets stemming from the Bonus Level. If you finish the game 100%, you will be rewarded for your efforts. (Getting 100% does not necessarily mean finding all the Heart Pieces, or even the cheat code)<br> <br> Level 5 is a large maze. It is possible to view the in-game map there, but some versions of ZC will crash if you open the map twice in one playthrough. Because of this, you may want to create your own map out of screenshots while playing it.",

For those on slower connections or computers, don't despair! The quest still has a high quality MIDI soundtrack, as well.<br> <br> As of V1.1 on July 27th, 2016, I've opted to package the trackers with the quest in hopes it'd get more people using them, as it seems like most people just run with the MIDI soundtrack. You can still grab the module files at <a href=\"http://bloodstar.rustedlogic.net/files/LTTSModsfinal.rar\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">this link</a>. You will need an archive reader that supports the RAR format to export these songs.

Sadly, I ended up taking about 30-40 hours to create it because I'm slow, and I get sidetracked often. Not to mention I actually bothered with detail. Ironically, I used 1.90-style mountains, and the quest is only about two hours long. <br> <br> It is named after an inflammation-reducing pill, which I happened to have a container of on my desk at the time.

All of these items are completely optional, but they will make the game much easier. And for clarification, there is a secret room in the optional dungeon before the final, but the rule of symmetry does not apply in this case.</li><li>If a concealed entrance on the overworld looks a bit too simple to uncover, you probably shouldn't go inside.</li><li>There are a total of 12 hearts in this quest.</li><li>Every B-button item slot can be filled.

This quest also features an MP3-exclusive OST, so make sure you put Rise of Ganon in the same folder as the OST, otherwise it won't play any music whatsoever:<br> <a href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/download/2c7njkv3u0cv9c8/Rise_of_Ganon_OST.zip\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">http://www.mediafire...f_Ganon_OST.zip</a>",
    "descriptionHtml": "Sometime after the original version of Neverending Fantasy was released, I wanted to make a simpler-structured quest that had a ZC newcomer-friendly feel to it. I say this because, at the time, I noticed a lot of quests were really confusing without any real sense of direction, even at the very beginning for their own good, often to the point of shutting off my attention all-together. That being said, however, the difficulty does start to pick up around Level 4, and even gave me a run for my money around Level 7, so it should be playable even for ZC veterans. This quest features a standard sized overworld with 9 main dungeons, 2 secret dungeons, and quite a few elusive secrets abound. As for the changes made to 2.5, this should be it here:<br><br>-Ganon can now be beaten in 2.5!<br>-Enhanced music replacing MIDIs<br>-BS Zelda sfx<br>-Some minor screen changes<br>-Boss HP has been tampered with<br>-Trap and Zora damage output has been upped<br>-Uses new text font<br>-Some quest rules changed to fix some glitches<br>-Tons of hidden rupee secrets<br><br>MAJOR UPDATE!<br>- New puzzles and key placements made in the dungeons to make them more challenging!<br>- Caves are a bit tougher to navigate<br>- Biggest Wallet and extra bomb upgrade are now in the game<br>- Total heart pieces bumped from 16 to 20<br>- Every dungeon now has a heart piece aside from the secret ones<br>- Some graphical tile fixes<br>- More typos squashed<br><br>UPDATE 6/21/15:<br>- Fixed bait cave bug<br><br>UPDATE 7/7/15<br>- Fixed jank block puzzle in level 2<br>- Fixed some of the block sfx<br><br>UPDATE 7/31/15<br>- Music updated to where names are a lot less generic<br>- Music changed for levels 4, 9, Death Mountain and Final Boss<br>- Some vague hints added to help player in confusing puzzles<br>- Fire Gleok has been nerfed<br><br>UPDATE 8/1/15:<br>- Some minor balances made to Level 9<br>- Heart Container now has a unique pickup sound<br><br>UPDATE 1/26/17:<br>- Minor aesthetical changes to tile placement<br>- block puzzle in Kakariko cave made less obnoxious<br>- overall, if you've beaten the game at this point, not really worth playing again for this minor update as it's merely just a polish touch-up.",
    "storyHtml": "So Ganon's been dead for some time, and a remnant of his army and high general, Synrilla, aims to revive his fallen master. Legend has it that it requires the sacrifice of one the bearers of the Triforce pieces. Given the Triforce of Courage has been lost for centuries, he aims for Zelda, given she still has the Triforce of Wisdom. However, in order to spare Zelda's life, Zelda told Synrilla of the hidden pieces of the Triforce of Courage, the legendary Hero and line of descendants who has slayed Ganon in the past. A remnant of that Hero, Link, lived deep within the Woods of Tatl, and Zelda made a bargain with Synrilla that if Link were to get to hidden pieces of the Triforce of Courage, and bring them to Hyrule Castle, he would post-pone Zelda's death sentence in return for Ganon having both the Triforce pieces for the ultimate revival. Of course, Zelda has faith that Link can defeat Synrilla, and stop Ganon's revival, so upon summoning Link through telepathy, Link begins the ultimate gamble of a quest!",

Also, the most recent update features an easier Level B, in which people commented that one section was too difficult.]",

There are no excuses here -- I have Windows 7 and I can run 2.10.",

Make sure you have bait before you beat level 8 to avoid frustration. 3. Level 8 only has 2 locked doors. Go south of both of them to find an invisible wall or bombable wall with the key's. There both optional doors with optional bosses.",

The tileset used was a very strange choice. You may recognize this from PolygonX8's (Exate) \"A Link to the Darkness 5\". Why I ever chose that tileset I don't know. This quest was initially a test of day to night transitions but it transformed quite quickly. A majority of this quest was worked on when I was 15. At the time I wasn't too mature, so some dialogue may seem cheesy, if not all of it. But that's what I think is the best part. The dialogue is like something you'd get out of an early 90's RPG...But this quest was my attempt to make a Zquest with a decent story, and show you players to not care so much about a great tileset. I do know how to do just about everything in Zquest, which you may not see right away. But I think this is one of those quests you should take a look at and try before you see a screenshot and say \"pass\". I was inspired a lot by Illusion of Gaia, the way heart pieces are obtained are like the red jewels. If you don't get a heart piece at a certain time, you'll never be able to get it again. So it keeps you checking areas if you want them all. There isn't tons of exploration, just like there isn't in Illusion of Gaia. Speaking of which, after I finished almost all of the quest, I played Terranigma and noticed some resemblances in the story... kind of. But anyway, enjoy if you choose to try this.",
    "storyHtml": "Once upon a time, a boy named Link was born in the kingdom of Hyrule. He grew up with his parents in Kakariko Village. They were explorers, and would take link exploring often. Some locations were dangerous, but it didn't bother them. Link would sometimes worry in his childhood where they would go, and if they were safe. In the spare time, Link would stay with his grandfather who would often take Link around caves, as he had a love for them. Link had a happy childhood, but things took a turn for the worse at the age of eleven. His parents disappeared, and many villagers rumored them to be dead. No one knew for sure. Link and his grandfather were not able to live in Kakariko Village anymore, they were too poor, and didn't want the townspeople talking about the incident, so they stayed in a cave north of the village. At the age of thirteen, it was announced that princess Zelda of Hyrule Castle was kidnapped. Link always felt after his parents left, there was nothing for him anymore, he couldn't live the same again. So he set out to rescue this princess, not caring the dangers that might face him. But what is he really getting himself into...?",

The quest provides the staple 9 dungeons to complete, plus several side dungeons you'll go through along the way.<br> <br> I hope you all enjoy my first quest!<br> <br> EDIT: Fixed a bug. Beforehand, if you went back to a Triforce room after getting the Triforce, you'd be stuck. I fixed that with adding in a portal in the Triforce room so you can leave easily.<br> EDIT 2: Added respawn points in the Triforce rooms should people go back to them and save there. This should solve the issue of people suddenly vanishing in said rooms when they restart the game from there. Hopefully this should be the last bug fix for this. Sorry for any inconvenience!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Two years ago, ZeldaClassic.com held a contest for an official fourth quest to be included in the release version of Zelda Classic 2.5. Because I was slow to get the news, I had little time to submit a version myself, yet I still wanted to try.<br> <br> However, I found a few of the rules for the official fourth quest contest to be a little restricting for me. These were mostly aesthetic issues, such as graphics and music, but some involved gameplay elements as well. Fortunately, by continuing on without the rules in mind, I was able to create alternate versions of the original quests with new tiles, extra music, and some extra gameplay tweaks.<br> <br> After creating DaDoc540's 1st Quest Remix, I decided to create a remix of the second quest, which is what I present to you here. The dungeon locations are mostly different from those of Doc's 1st, requisite items are harder to both locate and obtain, and more traps and hazards reside in the dungeons. The difficulty curve of this quest is certainly steeper than the last one, but not too steep. You have been warned…<br> <br> I played this quest myself extensively and am certain everything is working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can.<br> <br> **WARNING!**<br> This quest is more difficult than the previous one, so do not try this quest under the following circumstances:<br> -You do not have the experience of completing various quests of high difficulty.<br> -You have trouble fighting certain difficult enemies, namely Blue Darknuts and Wizzrobes. (Only classic enemies are used here.)<br> -You have great difficulty in finding hidden secrets.<br> -You have Wile E. Coyote syndrome (i.e. unable to quit something until you complete it)<br> <br> Please do not rate this quest with a score based solely on the difficulty. If you can handle the difficulty, this should provide a worthwhile challenge.<br> <br> **Update** vravelo brought my attention to a major bug in Level 9 that can trap the player. The bug should be removed. My apologies!",

    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "You will be without a sword at the beginning for a short time. Listen to the advice of the Old Man at the first screen to find both the first dungeon and your first sword.<br> <br> Wait until you obtain your first sword before you save. If something happens that prevents you from obtaining the first sword, select \"Retry\" from the Continue menu and try again.<br> <br> Make sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction. Also note the consequences of pushing a block in a certain direction; a push the wrong way could block you from reaching the passageway.<br> Note: It should be impossible to completely seal yourself in such a way that forces you to reset.<br> <br> Always make sure you have found every requisite item from each dungeon. You often need an item in one dungeon to either enter or complete a future dungeon.<br> <br> Visit Info booths for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items, namely Sword upgrades, and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.",

Either way, hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it! It's three dungeons (and one mini-dungeon) long, and contains a cave system and a small overworld. Make sure you explore places thoroughly to find everything.

Since ZCR is going down, and I'm releasing its sequel soon, I figured it needs to have a home. Its design is kind of inconsistent, as a result of the improvised nature of the quest, but people have told me it's kinda fun for what it is.<br><br>It was made for 1.92 Beta 184... although it probably works fine in later versions.<br><br>There is one very minor swear word in it. It barely merits mentioning, but I just thought I would. You probably won't even bat an eye at it.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is a goofy quest I worked on periodically from 2009-2011. I'm really proud of it, even if it's not perfect and a bit rough around the edges. It's a spiritual sequel to the first I Hate Mayonnaise, although it really doesn't share much in common with that quest beyond the tileset and overall atmosphere. It's far longer and there's way more to do.<br> <br> There are 5 dungeons and many more minidungeons. It probably won't take you too long to beat -- roughly 6-7 hours on the first playthrough, and that's if you bother to retrieve everything.<br> <br> This was originally intended to be a sister quest to Exate's <strong class=\"bbc\"><a href=\"https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&amp;id=402\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"\">Pessimistic Pizza</a></strong>, hence the title, and they were meant to come out around the same time. However, due to delays in both quests development, that plan didn't work out.<br> <br> This quest was mostly designed in 2.10, so it mostly sticks to that version's features. There's not much in terms of scripts or new mechanics in this quest. I mostly just focused on design. And the pretty colors.<br> <br> Hope you enjoy it!<br> <br> <em class=\"bbc\">Last updated: 02/16/2016. Current version: 1.11.2.</em>",

    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "<p class=\"bbc_indent\">• Nearly every object out of the ordinary has significance to it -- pay very close attention to them. And slash every bush/every tall grass tile you can find! Not only is this a very fast way to accumulate money (which you will need) and keep your health high, but many things are hidden in the grass.<br> <br> • When you get the whistle, the warp ring takes you to: The potion shop, the wand shop, the southwestern most screen in Canyonero, and the entrance to Shiptown Township. You can take advantage of this to quickly get potions late in the game.<br> <br> • For your reference, large crystals must have magic directed towards them in order to cause a reaction. Smaller gems embedded in blocks require *reflected* magic (ie. with the mirror shield).<br> <br> • There's a few NPCs in Shiptown Township that offer useful advice, and you can purchase the blue ring and other things there (also, the raft, a required item, is only obtainable there). The entrance to there is in the southernmost section of Festivity Fields.<br> <br> • There are five heart containers scattered around the world in addition to the four you get from boss fights. You may also retrieve three higher level swords beyond the Splinter Sword you start off with, and there are large rupee amounts hidden in various caves. Exploration is good, so be sure to look around!<br> <br> • You can get the Lens of Truth as soon as you get the Red Candle (Sunny B. Light). I'm not gonna point out specifically where, but if you find it, you can basically break the game wide open.<br> <br> • I'd recommend bringing a pen and paper to level 4 -- it's quite a bit more confusing than I'd hoped it would end up being. Or you can just look at the map file packaged with the quest.</p> If you need any more help, feel free to post in the <strong class=\"bbc\"><a href=\"https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=52792\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"\">help thread</a></strong>!",

Somewhere along the line I forgot that I was doing a simple bugfix and added a ton of new features. Since this was one of my earlier ventures into scripting, I didn't want to modify the old code...actually I was just lazy. As a result, all of the new stuff was scripted without the use of modern resources like ghost.zh and any lag issues may not be fixed entirely. I tried to clean out some of the old code, but I could only tolerate so much.<br> Features new to this update:<ul class=\"bbc\"><li>A brand new goofy bonus dungeon filled with brand new enemies and brand new desperation attacks</li><li>A brand new goofy bonus boss</li><li>A brand new ending that's just as goofy as the bonus dungeon and boss</li><li>A new power for an old item</li><li>Boss names on health bars</li><li>A new custom subscreen</li><li>Various bugfixes and tweaks</li></ul> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">[UPDATE 7/16/19]</strong> Apparently despite this being quite an old quest, people are still playing it for some reason. After watching one too many streams of people suffering to some of the more questionable decisions, I finally decided to make the easy and obvious fixes. Took me long enough.<ul class=\"bbc\"><li>The quest tells you about the mouse control element at the start.

It looks a little strange but it's functionally better.</li><li>Demon hearts should now disappear after getting Goddess Band.</li><li>All red bubbles have been removed and replaced with temporary ones.</li><li>Boss refights no longer respawn.</li><li>A few very minor layout changes in dungeons to make some stuff less confusing and avoid some time wastes.</li><li>Mirror wizzrobes die in one hit and one of them has been removed.

    "descriptionHtml": "<span><span>After finishing my latest classic quest remixes, I thought I was finished with the Classic Overworld. While I remain most devoted to the Classic tileset, I was intent on creating a wholy new quest, as a Classic Overworld can only be used so many times.<br> <br> It was when I realized that many, if not most, Classic Overworld quests (with varying tilesets) were of a single layer that I realized that one can still add depth to a Classic Overworld quest with one tweak: multiple layers. In this case, I took the original, Classic Overworld, restuctured it with my version of a Classic graphics pack (namely palette, tiles, and combos), and added multiple layers to create taller trees, larger boulders, fences for bridges, microblocks in dungeons, etc. I hope with this quest, one can see the potential of any good tileset, so long as one uses layering to add depth to an otherwise single layer map.<br> <br> Compared to my previous two quests based off of the Original Classic Overworld, the difficulty should be manageable to most people.<br> <br> As usual, I played this quest myself thoroughly and am certain everything should be working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can. Also, I will continue to aesthetically update this quest as new tiles become available.<br> <br> I hope you enjoy it.<br> <br> (Update 7/18/12): Filled in an empty cave Artistic discovered; improved aesthetics, primarily of grassy, wooded areas.<br> <br> (Update 7/29/12): Lowered the rupee amount of some \"Secret Money\" rooms to reduce chance of overflow; added and improved more aesthetics, most notably the addition of stone walkways (as seen on screenshot 10).<br> <br> (Update 8/13/12): Removed enemies from an in-dungeon shop (No more unruly \"customers\"!); further minor aesthetic improvements.<br> <br> (MAJOR UPDATE 2/5/13): After three months of work, First Quest Layered is now formatted for version 2.50. While the general structure of this quest has remained the same, the items and enemies have changed. True Arrows are used (with Arrow ammunition and counter), and both quiver and bomb bag upgrades are available. While most of the enemies maintain most or all of their previous traits and behaviors, some have been totally revamped. Plus, new enemies not present in the previous update have been added.<br> <br> Even if you have played this quest before in its 2.10 version, I highly recommend that you give this new version a try. Make sure you have Zelda Classic 2.50 to run it through. I hope you enjoy it as much as the older version.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span><span><span><span>(Update 5/20/13): Minor improvement of aesthetics.</span></span></span></span></span><br> <br> <span><span><span><span><span>(Update 7/17/13): Addition of new enemies, most notably the Stalchild and the Helmasaur. Look out for the former in the Graveyard. Also, Gels, Chuchus, and Zols act like the new Gibdos, using Eat (Damage) touch effects, but still require one hit to split or kill.</span></span></span></span></span><br> <br> <span><span><span><span><span>(Update 12/24/13): Overhaul of dungeon wall aesthetics, slight changes to some dungeon rooms to involve more item use.</span></span></span></span></span>",
    "storyHtml": "<span><span>The Triforce of Courage has been split into eight fragments, each hidden away in different underground labyrinths of Hyrule and guarded by formidable creatures. Only a Hero courageous, wise, and strong enough can reclaim the eight fragments and reassemble the Triforce of Courage to prove oneself worthy to challenge Ganon, the King of Thieves, who has been wreaking havoc upon the once prosperous Hyrule. Are you the one?</span></span>",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "<span><span>Make sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.<br> <br> The five loose Heart Containers (i.e. those not dropped by slain dungeon bosses) have been split into twenty Heart Pieces. Most are scattered and hidden throughout the overworld, but be on the lookout for a few hidden in dungeons as well.<br> <br> Visit Info booths around the Overworld and Old Men in dungeons for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.<br> <br> While this is not as difficult as my previous two quests, the end can still be a challenge. Unless you have impeccable memory, I suggest players to write down notes, sketches, etc. when exploring the later dungeons. You do not want to forget where one-way shutters are located!<br> <br> Version 2.50:</span></span><br> <span><span>Remember that, unlike in the original <em class=\"bbc\">Legend of Zelda</em>, your Arrows are limited, so conserve them for enemies that require Arrows for defeat (e.g. Gohma, Ganon). Enemies weak to Arrows, such as Tektites, and enemies that fire Arrows, namely Moblins, drop Arrows when defeated. There are Quiver upgrades in addition to Bomb Bag upgrades hidden throughout dungeons.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>While most of the enemies are the same as before, others have been changed dramatically. Four notable examples are the Lynel, the Gel, the Zol, the Gibdo, and the Pols Voice. New enemies, such as the Helmasaur, are also present.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Lynels no longer pause to shoot fire blasts and will charge at you upon sight.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Gels, Chuchus, and Zols all cling onto you to feed off of your vitality, but still require one hit to split or kill.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Gibdos can now grab onto you and drain your vitality until destroyed.<br> -Pols Voice are no longer very weak to arrows but can be instantly killed with something else; however, the Ocarina (Whistle) is not effective enough to injure the ears.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Being smaller than Darknuts, Helmasaurs have less vitality but are shielded on all sides except its back. If running or sneaking behind it proves too difficult or unreliable, a well placed bomb will work.</span></span>",

Instead of running around, solving dungeons and saving the world, you get to run around, shooting and slashing hordes of enemies into oblivion. The game is divided into levels, which you can revisit from the main hub. All of the game's 16 items can be bought in a centralized shop, where you can find the best selection of equipment for your fighting style.<br>So what are you waiting for?! Download now and start blowing stuff up!<br><br>Main features:<br>9 unique levels of mayhem!<br>A scripted scoring system to encourage replayability (and practice your mad skills)!<br>4 categories of all-scripted weapons (12 total) to choose from!<br>A working, side-scrolling space level!<br>Ultra-powerful hidden bosses, guarding an additional 4 weapons to collect!<br>And... a jaw-droppingly awesome main character<br><br>This game has an enhanced music file that plays in the last level. For legal reasons, PureZC can't host that file in the quest database. To get it, search for \"megaman x8 jakob download\" to find the MP3, and then put it in the same folder as the .qst file or the ZC executable, and call it \"CIS LVL9 MP3.mp3\". If you don't do this, an ordinary MIDI will play in its place. If you can't or don't want to find it yourself, you can send me a PM and I'll give you a link to the file.<br><br>11/11/12: Added an opening cutscene that almost explains what's going on, and fixed a few bugs and a typo or two.<br><br>11/26/12: More semi-important updates.<br><br>12/12/12: Fixed the enemy respawn bug and un-blocked a door that should not have been blocked.<br><br>5/31/13: New game-over and level complete animations, less un-hittable Neo-Gohmoid, plus minor tweaks.",

You can have 20 hearts in total, 4 different defence rings (immortality ring not availible in final dungeon), 3 Roc's feather levels (L1 only in final dungeon), Low and high level dins fire (L1 only in final dungeon), short and long hookshots, 5 different swords including the broken blade, and you can buy up to 6 potions (3 in the beginning) from the potion shop girl, Arukas.<br> <br> There will be a 2.0 release later on that will have the 1st quest with extras not availible in this release, and a 2nd quest availible with a similar, yet eerily different overworld, stronger enemies, altered dungeons and altered locations, 3 ruins at old locations, extra story (taking place about a year later), and items and upgrades left unused (or are 2nd quest only)!<br> <br> Update 1: The old version was buggy and I didn't mean to release that version.<br> <br> Update 2: I also fixed the warping to the entrance to the master sword battle from dying in the mirror shield room, The respawn room will warp you back to Arukas's house.<br> <br> Update 3: The Final Gauntlet's block puzzle segment is now easier since you can go to the room before, and the tiles the blocks are supposed to go on are brighter, but you will have to redo the block puzzle from the room you walk back to because the rooms reset and I can't fix that...",
    "storyHtml": "WARNING: LONG STORY!<br> <br> Reach Mana (Weapon: Grappling Hook) of the Mountainican Noble lineage is an athlete of the MMRL. Final race of the season he is racing his rival and best friend simply nicknamed \"Jumps\" (Weapon: Springed Boots) for the title of Champion. Near the end of the race they are both teleported to a giant nuclear bomb with a male figure floating in front of them. Reach identifies the person, but hides his knowledge. They destroy the nuke and escape. a few days later the nuke is rebuilt and headed on a crash course for Mountainica. Reach explains to Jumps that the man was Sora (Weapon: Wings), Reach's previous rival who died in a more dangerous VVRL race 2 years ago. Sora is prompt to teleport them on top of the rebuilt nuke, reveal a pair of demon horns, and fight them. After Sora was defeated, he sent them to Hell with him where Reach took his L2 sword (Satan's Bird. A 1 hit banishment on demons). When Sora was banished to the waiting room he used a spell to bring Reach's girlfriend Run (Weapon: Rocket Shoes) and Jumps's girlfriend (Reach's little sister) Itsuki (Weapon: Digging Mitts) to Hell as well. The party of 4 leave to The Hell Motel where we meet Mutoh (Weapon: Hand Shoes), the weird guy who always handstands and is Jumps's equal to Reach and Sora. Afterwards they find a grassland... in Hell? They take it as a blessing and go inside. They rest up and are about to leave when 2 demon girls: Sakura (Weapon: 2 stabbing Knives) equal to Run, and Sue (Weapon: Stilts) equal to Itsuki, cast curses on the land and leave it as barren as the rest of Hell. That in mind, Reach and Co. decide to dig their way into Satan's Castle with Itsuki's Digging Mitts. When they enter Satan's Castle each teammate is picked off 1 by 1 starting with Itsuki and Sue, then Jumps and Mutoh, then Run and Sakura, ending with a battle between Reach and Sora where Reach loses Satan's Bird. Sora is defeated and begs Satan for more power. Satan reluctantly gives him the power and pays for it with his life. Sora becomes the new demonlord and Hell turns into a real sea of flames. Things happen, everyone gets seperated, and Reach wakes up in a bed. He sees Sakura and begins to grab his Grappling hook. Before he attacks her, she reveals to him that she saved his life, she doesn't work for Sora, and she wants to help him in his fight against Sora. She makes a deal with him and becomes his servant for as long as Sora is alive. They find Run first and it leads to a slightly awkward moment. They find Itsuki with a girl named Shiro (Weapon: White Magic) and later another girl named Kuro (Weapon: Black Magic) who have healing arts and destructive arts only matched by each other. Jumps finds the island and leaps over to them. Reach tames a dragon and they go to a hot spring. at the hot spring they meet the girl Test Subject K-3 (Weapon: Mind control, brainwashing, etc.) who joins the party at 8th. They head towards Sora's Castle split into three groups and lead an offensive to take control of the outer land. Sakura teams with Shiro and Kuro, Test Subject K-3 teams with Run and Itsuki, and Jumps and Reach drop right at the front door with Mutoh waiting for them. After Mutoh is defeated, a robot zombie monster clone of Sora falls out of the sky and fights too. Sakura gets in a fight with Sue and has her demon horns ripped off. Healing items depleted, Reach calls Sakura's team and asks for them to return to the front entrance. Itsuki finds the back entrance and her team clears out the first floor. The team reunited continues towards Sora, but not before Sakura gives Reach her L1 Sword (Super finger). Sora reveals His new L3 sword (Satan's Claw) with an odd accuracy killer. They fight, Satan comes back as a Pen being who is far stronger than the Pencil beings of Reach's homeworld, and we find out Sora killed Sakura's older brother Sousuke between the times of Sora's takeover and the party seperation. The fight continues, Sora removes the accuracy killer, and he kills Reach. Reach is alive inside of his own subconcious and meets Hcaer (Weapon: Boomerang) of the Opposite Universe. They merge spirits and Reach is revived with a new sword (Repent finger) that cancels out the power of Satan's Claw. Finally Sora is defeated and drops to the floor, but it's not over yet! 2nd form Sora froze Hell he was so powerful. They defeat him and are given a sudden death between Reach and Sora. Reach wins and we finally get to the beginning of this quest! Shortly afterward we meet Reach's father Rentetsu (Weapon: Ice picks) who dies of natural causes 15 days after Reach's 24th birthday. This all happened over the course of about 11 months. This quest starts on the 9th month.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "Tip: Many small trees are bombable! If you get spin attack (and I suggest you do!) use it to find if a small tree is bombable.<br> <br> Tip: There are many spiked roads! There are 2 ways to manage the spiked roads: Roc's feather and normal boots. I use the Roc's feather because it's a required item! There is only 1 place to find the Roc's Feather!<br> <br> Tip: Abay is an annoyance, but he does give you awesome things!<br> <br> WARNING:SPOILERS<br> <br> Mini-Walkthrough: First you'll want to get your L1 Sword. Head east until you can't head anymore east and go south then west and you'll find Pencil Tower. Inside Pencil Tower you'll be avoiding enemies and finding keys for your first visit. When you get to the first boss your sword will be right in front of you. Grab it and kill the aquamentus quickly, a heart container is in the room beyond it. After you complete the first visit you'll need bombs. The cave to get bombs is southwest of Pencil Tower on the beach. In The Crescent Moon Cave You'll avoid spiked floors and be killing a custom mid-boss known as a grabber twice. Once you get the bombs head back to the room you got the heart container in and bomb the left wall. Kill the goriyas for the map and go left. kill the darknut and get the key behind the blocks. Open the locked door and kill the wallmasters. Go right, kill the stalfos, and grab the key. Go north, kill more stalfos, and grab the boss key. DON'T go through the locked door! If you do you'll be cursed to have the L1.5 Sword (Broken blade. fires sword beams as long as you have atleast 1 full heart) until you get the magic key. Instead go to the menu, exit game, continue, and head back to the wallmaster room. go north and kill the moldorms. go left and go south. Kill the 2 aquamentus' and get the heart container. Enter the portal and kill the moldorm army for the L2 Sword. Buy your arrow from the shopkeep in town. Head east and follow the tall grass path until you reach the Pen Cave. Avoid spikes, kill enemies, and get the bow before you fight Optomon (Played as a ghoma) who will give you the silver arrow. Take the portal to fight a manhandla and get a heart container. The next portal takes you to a 12 headed gleeok which is nearly unkillable as you are. Leave and go southtoward the beach. You might want to buy the boots that keep you from getting hurt by spikes (I don't because it's not required) The Rentetsu Shrine is along the beach and on a spiked road. Run through the road (if you didn't get the boots you'll need atleast 1 potion) and enter the shrine. Now get the 1st ball of light on your own! Boss: Manhandla.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Quest made in ZC 2.5.<br><br>Here are facts about this quest, wich you should read before playing!!<br>- This quest is only about fighting enemies, so if thats not for you, go away ;D<br>- You can choose between German and English.<br>- At the beginning you can choose one out of seven characters.<br>- Those are Hero, Druid, Mage, Blocker, Berserc, Warlock, Ninja and theres one secret character you dont know.<br>- Press the MAP button to return to the character selection menu!!! &lt;- Good to know<br>- There 6 levels and a final level.<br>- If you loose all your HP (hearts), you die. Then you have to restart the level.<br>- EVERY character has a sword and a magic wand. The magic wand uses MP (mana points).<br>- EVERY character can slash.<br>- EVERY character also has a chance to land a critical hit, wich is only for the sword attacks not the magical attacks.<br>- No diagonal movement, this time!!<br>- You can save whenever you want. And you should, if you take a break from the quest. When you finish the quest with one character you get a medal for that character. When you have all medals, you have finished the quest 100%!<br><br>The Zip file also contains the important character table, where you can see the stats of all characters, like MP, HP, Magical Power, Sword Power, Movement, and more.<br><br>The characters:<br><br>-Hero- Difficulty: Easy<br>This is the character from the screenshot . As you can see he has lots of HP but is lacking MP and magical power. His strenght is close combat, as he can deal great damage with his sword.<br><br>-Druid- Diffictulty: Normal<br>A very balanced character, although his sword attacks are not the best. His great advantage lies in its special ability \"Natural Regeneration\", wich slowly increases his HP, permanently.<br><br>-Mage- Difficulty: Normal<br>While his sword attacks are really weak, his magical power is incredible! This character's strenght is ranged combat, using his magic wand he can beat all his enemies. His ability \"Recovery of Spirit\" slowly refills his MP, permanently.<br><br>-Blocker- Difficulty: Normal<br>This mysterious character has lots of power, his sword attacks are almost as strong as the Hero's sword attacks. His magical attacks however, don't do any damage! Instead they block the enemie's movement for a short amount of time (he stuns enemies). Also, he is one of the few characters who have a shield.<br><br>-Berserc- Difficulty: Normal<br>Another very balanced character, with a great ability. You can press L to turn on the \"Berserc-Mode\", and R to turn it off. In Berserc-Mode, your sword deals doubled damage!!, but you will instantly die if you get hit in this mode, so it's a great risk. You have to think about when you use it, and when you don't.<br><br>-Warlock- Difficulty: Hard<br>The HP and MP of the Warlock are pretty low. However, the Warlock has a helpful special ability, the \"Heart-Mana Transfer\". By pressing L or R, he can use this ability to turn 1 MP into 1 HP to heal himself, or to sacrifice 1 HP to get 1 MP at will, so he can do more magical attacks.<br><br>-Ninja- Difficulty: Hard<br>This character can run faster than all others! It is easy for him, to dodge all dangers. He also has a high chance of landing a critical hit with his sword, even though the damage bonus is not very high.<br><br>UPDATE: Fixed all remaining known bugs.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<span rel=\"lightbox\">Posted Image</span><span><span><strong class=\"bbc\">LQftH2 Version Lunaria.0</strong></span><span rel=\"lightbox\">Posted Image</span></span><br> <br> I decided to update the quest again in response to Lunaria's rather lengthy review and address most of her complaints. In the process I ended up having a little fun and overhauling a significant portion of the quest, adding a ton of new stuff. The dungeon graphics and layouts are still the same, but there's a ton of new content added. In this update you can expect to see:<ul class=\"bbc\"><li><strong class=\"bbc\">New Dungeons:</strong> One of the first things I set out to do was replacing the less well received bonus dungeons with more fair ones. Moosh's Ways, Veni Vidi Vici, and Ultimate Test are still in the quest, but have been moved over to a different game setting called Legacy Mode. The same goes for Level 7 Hard Mode. On top of that, there's a completely new bonus dungeon.</li><li><strong class=\"bbc\">New Bosses: </strong>Most of the boss related stuff in this update is small tweaks to old bosses, but there's a couple new ones thrown into the mix.</li><li><strong class=\"bbc\">New Enemies: </strong>Some old dungeons have new enemies in them and some old enemies are returning with scripted tricks up their sleeves.</li><li><strong class=\"bbc\">Weapons to Surpass Metal Gear: </strong>New to this update are seven tier 5 swords. Seven. Tier 5. They're crazy. Each is based on a Zelda Classic let's player or streamer. If you're a returning player eager to see the new content, you can even use a cheat to start the game with a powered down version of one of them. And there's a few new passive items to collect on the side.</li><li><strong class=\"bbc\">A Whole New World:</strong> A new fantastic point of view! No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming...Ahem, sorry. The overworld in the original version of the quest was complete skippable trash, almost anything would be better. So I took some inspiration from NewJourneysFire's TRIFORCE which apparently took inspiration from me, and redesigned the entire overworld. I also added some caves and a small town to expand on the world's lore a bit. I think this is my best overworld so far.</li><li><strong class=\"bbc\">Difficulty Modes:</strong> To make the quest more accessible to different types of players, I've added different difficulty levels that change enemy damage. You can change difficulty at any time, but the game will keep track of the lowest you've played on.</li><li><strong class=\"bbc\">Fedora Hunt: </strong>There are a few megasecrets (items that do not show up on the subscreen) and easter eggs hidden around. See what you can find...</li></ul> I hope this update will be an enjoyable experience for new players and returning players alike.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">Update 3/22/2016: </strong>Fixed a few bugs and made some tweaks to some of the LP weapons.<br> <strong class=\"bbc\">Update 4/25/2016: </strong>Addressed the common complaint about overhead layers obscuring enemies and tweaked the bonus boss some more.",

Claiming to have reformed, Dracus strikes a deal with them: they must team up in order to defeat the now-insane Lucis. With no other option, Link and Rose accept.<br> <br> So many questions gnaw on their minds though. What's going on? Has Lucis really gone insane, or is something else more sinister at work here?

He also sprited the final boss. This game would have looked much different, and much worse, were it not for him.<br> Evan20000 was also a huge help. He frequently gave me advice and feedback, and really helped with the difficulty balancing. His own quest was also a big inspiration to me at parts.<br> Finally, SpacemanDan has helped me debug more scripts for this thing than I care to remember. He's also given me tons of genera advice and encouragement, and if that weren't enough, he's sprited a few things for the game too.<br> <br> Now, for credits in general:<br> Graphics: Radien, for the DoR tileset. Peteo and DFW, for the Lost Isle tileset. SpacemanDan, for multiple sprites. Lightwulf, for misc sprites. Jupiter, for lots of trees. Linkus, for dungeon tiles. Scootaloo, for the Link tiles. Mariomario, for the Dracus sprites. Moosh, for the final boss sprites. Orin XD, for misc character sprites. Revfan9, for the horizon background. From the Spriter's Resource: Faty McGee, Smithygon, Robbydude, CrimsonPenguin, Mr. C, and Bean<br> Music: Alestance, Bjorn_Lynne, Espilan, Joan-Michele, Jormungand, Strato, Zagro, the contributors to the Original Midi Pack who were unnamed, and VGMusic submitters whose names I've unfortunately lost.<br> Special mention for Alestance, who, in addition to writing a few songs, gave lots of suggestions, and compiled the Original Midi Pack that I frequently used.<br> SFX: Helpthewretched, Jurassic Park.<br> Scripts/scripting help: Moosh, SpacemanDan, Saffith, SurrealCanine, and Joe123.<br> Beta Testing: Moosh, Evan20000, SurrealCanine, and my own best friend who prefers to go unnamed.<br> Post game bug finding: Special callout for Aevin, who's been a big help with those few bugs that slipped by.<br> None of this would have been possible without Nintendo, so they obviously get credit.<br> And finally, you, for the taking the time to read this all and play the game.<br> <br> If you deserve a place in the credits and I forgot to credit you, PLEASE let me know ASAP so I can give you proper credit",

    "descriptionHtml": "<span><span>After finishing my latest classic quest remixes, I thought I was finished with the Classic Overworld. While I remain most devoted to the Classic tileset, I was intent on creating a wholy new quest, as a Classic Overworld can only be used so many times.<br> <br> It was when I realized that many, if not most, Classic Overworld quests (with varying tilesets) were of a single layer that I realized that one can still add depth to a Classic Overworld quest with one tweak: multiple layers. In this case, I took the original, Classic Overworld, restuctured it with my version of a Classic graphics pack (namely palette, tiles, and combos), and added multiple layers to create taller trees, larger boulders, fences for bridges, microblocks in dungeons, etc. I hope with this quest, one can see the potential of any good tileset, so long as one uses layering to add depth to an otherwise single layer map.<br> <br> After the mostly positive feedback from First Quest Layered, I realized that a sequel was needed, so I crafted this quest with the same basic Overworld with small changes in topography and different locations of dungeons, items, and other secrets. This quest is slightly more difficult than its predecessor, particularly in puzzle solving.<br> <br> As usual, I played this quest myself thoroughly and am certain everything should be working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can. Also, I will continue to aesthetically update this quest as new tiles become available.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>I hope you enjoy it.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>(Update 5/20/13): Fixed/improved various aesthetics:</span></span><br> <span><span>-Overworld, 4B: missing Layer 1 combos</span></span><br> <span><span>-Overworld, 5E: removed unnecessary Secret Combo Flags from Tall Grass edges made obsolete by \"Tall Grass –&gt; Next\" Combos</span></span><br> <span><span>-Level 1, 52: removed unnecessary Secret Combo Flags from doorway</span></span><br> <span><span>-White Sword Palace, 13: turned on lights in block puzzle room to conserve player's Magic meter upon retrials</span></span><br> <span><span>-Level 8: restructured Side Warps transitioning from flooded to non-flooded areas</span></span><br> <span><span>-Level 8, 51: replaced \"Burn (Any)\" flag with \"Burn (Wand Fire)\" flag to necessitate acquisition of Magic Book</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>(Update 5/23/13):</span></span><br> <span><span>-Shop 0: (closest one to starting point is one screen northwest) sells Large Magic Jars for 25 Rupees instead of Life Potions to allow for easier Magic refills</span></span><br> <span><span>-Overworld, screen 22: changed Shop to Potion Shop, now requires Mushroom (Letter) for commerce</span></span><br> <span><span>-Overworld, screen 50: benign Moblin now offers advice instead of free Rupees</span></span><br> <span><span>-Level 4, 02: teleport tile returns player just in front of the south doorway of the room, resets block puzzle to prevent player trapping oneself</span></span><br> <span><span>-Level 6, 42-52: middle doorway is now open, while right doorway is locked to allow access to block maze, require acquisition of another key, and avoid preventing player from completing dungeon</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>(Update 12/24/13):</span></span><br> <span><span>-Overhaul of dungeon wall aesthetics.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Added a missing Map and Compass in Level 5.</span></span>",
    "storyHtml": "<span><span>The Triforce of Wisdom has been split into eight fragments, each hidden away in different underground labyrinths of Hyrule and guarded by formidable creatures.

Are you the one?</span></span>",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "<span><span>Make sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span><span><span>Obtaining Sword upgrades is no longer a simple matter of locating swordsmiths; they have to be earned by exploring Sword Palaces, one for the White Sword and another for the Magic Sword. The minimum Heart Container requirements still apply (five for White, twelve for Magic), but each Sword Palace boss drops a full Heart Container when slain.</span></span></span></span><br> <br> <span><span>Seven loose Heart Containers (i.e. those not dropped by slain dungeon bosses) have been split into twenty eight Heart Pieces. Most are scattered and hidden throughout the Overworld, but be on the lookout for a few hidden in dungeons as well.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>This quest enforces the use of a Magic meter, which begins at four blocks. </span></span><span><span>There are four extra Magic Containers hidden in either the Overworld or in one of the dungeons.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>Visit Info booths around the Overworld and Old Men in dungeons for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>The final few dungeons can be a challenge. Unless you have impeccable memory, I suggest players to write down notes, sketches, etc. when exploring the later dungeons. You do not want to forget where one-way shutters are located!</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>While most of the enemies are the same as before, others have been changed dramatically. Three notable examples are the Lynel, the Gibdo, and the Pols Voice:</span></span><br> <span><span>-Lynels no longer pause to shoot fire blasts and now charge at you when standing in its line of sight.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Gibdos can now grab onto you and drain your vitality until destroyed.</span></span><br> <span><span>-Pols Voice are no longer very weak to arrows but can be instantly killed with something else; however, the Ocarina (Whistle) is not effective enough to injure the ears.</span></span>",

We wanted to release both quests in the same period, but due largely to motivational issues on my end, that didn't happen.<br> <br> Design on this quest began during the end of November '09, when I had the motivation to do another \"joke\"-esque quest. I originally intended to release this quest during Christmas of the same year, but the work I was putting in didn't allow for such a quick release.<br> <br> The bulk of the quest was finished within the next year or two, but I wanted to add a bunch of secrets to the quest. A large, extra dungeon kept the game in development limbo for the next couple of years, as I couldn't bring myself to work on it very much. My preference for a lot of the things in the quest changed over time, but I couldn't motivate myself to work on those, either. I did, however, manage to transition this quest from 1.92 to 2.50. It still plays like a 1.92 quest, but has the added convenience of arrow ammunition, and a revised subscreen.<br> <br> I came to the conclusion that the quest wasn't going to have all the other things I wanted to add, so I decided to tie up the loose ends, and release it as-is. My original goal was to be more satisfied with this than its prequel, and I managed to accomplish that long ago.<br> <br> <br> <u>About the Quest</u><br> If you've played Ibuprofen, then you already kind of know what to expect. The quest still has an overall very simplistic design to it, and it progresses almost exactly the same as the last quest. There's just a lot more creativity in this one.<br> <br> The dungeons in this quest are something of a novelty display. They aren't very complex, either.<br> <br> As the sibling quest to IHM2, this quest shares a couple of perks: You start with farore's wind, and there's a \"death tree\".<br> <br> The difficulty may be considered average by most. The final dungeon is harder than the bulk of the game.<br> On this note, some enemies (aquamentus, gleeok, and ganon) were buffed. Death knights were nerfed; they move no faster than Link, do less damage, and stop moving before firing. Mirrorobes were also nerfed; they do less damage.<br> <br> The quest also features custom SFX. Lots. Its the primary culprit of the file size.<br> <br> The quest name, like its predecessor, is irrelevant to the actual game. It has personal significance to me, but nothing more.",

    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "<ul class=\"bbc\"><li>Each and every dungeon has a secret room that contains an optional item. There are no blatant hints on-screen as how to obtain these, but that's not an issue if you keep this in mind: The secret rooms in conjunction with the displayed map make the dungeon shape symmetrical (with the exception of two dungeons). All of these items are completely optional, but they can make the game easier if acquired ASAP. As for the exceptions... Level 2 has two rooms, and they are situated somewhere at the upper section of the dungeon. The item dungeon, however... that's up to you!</li><li>If a concealed entrance on the overworld looks a bit too simple to uncover, you probably shouldn't go inside.</li><li>There are a total of 16 hearts in this quest; you have the primary 12 as with the last quest, and 4 very well-hidden ones.</li><li>Every B-button item slot can be filled. The blue candle is the only item that does not appear.</li><li>The lens of truth drains magic instead of rupees (as was the case with <em class=\"bbc\">Ibuprofen</em>). Din's fire also consumes magic.</li><li>All equipment slots can be filled. Obtainable equipment includes: Wooden/white/magic/master swords, ladder, flippers, magic meter, blue/red/gold rings, magic/mirror shields, power bracelets, amulet, boots, and din's fire. You begin with 500 rupees, farore's wind, the quiver, and the \"letter\". The wealth medal and the raft are also obtainable, but are well-hidden.</li><li>The level 1 cheat is hidden in the quest. I will not disclose what it is, or where it is located.</li><li>And for those whom didn't know already, if the quest author has enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot rule, the magic boomerang blocks magic, and <u>the fire boomerang reflects it</u>. To tell if this rule is enabled, items will be \"pulled\" back to you when they make contact with the boomerang or hookshot. If they're instantly acquired, the rule is off. <strong class=\"bbc\">The rule is enabled in this quest. Please don't forget it!</strong></li></ul>",

The archeologist's teenage son didn't have much respect at all for his father. The man was two-faced. Kind and enthusiastic in front of a camera, but mean, almost abusive, when in private. Elliot found his father's field of work fascinating, but resented being dragged around from place to place and being forced to do all the hard work. \"Go through this small tunnel, Elliot.\" \"Carry my tools for me, Elliot.\" \"Don't you <em class=\"bbc\">dare</em> sass off to me or I will make your life miserable, Elliot.\"<br> <br> Mean as his father might be though, Elliot never had any reason to suspect he was any more than an egotistical jerk. Until one day, when his father sent him crawling through yet another muddy tunnel in a cave to scout ahead. On the other side though, Elliot found something quite different than normal. A hallway, lined with crumbling pillars, ending in a sealed door. And a glove, and a voice beckoning him to pick up the glove...<br> <br> Elliot's life collapsed in that moment, as the glove spoke, explaining things Elliot didn't want to hear. His father was searching for something, something called the Vault of Souls. And if he were to find and open it, it would mean catastrophe. Elliot is forced into a search to locate the three key shards to seal the vault before Dr Devar can reach it, in a quest that could ultimately pit father against son in a showdown that, despite how they might act on the outside, neither of them want to happen.<br> <br> <em class=\"bbc\">The Vault of Souls is discovered.

    "storyHtml": "\"Pong (marketed as PONG) is one of the earliest arcade video games; it is a tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat the opponent in a simulated table tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari Incorporated (Atari), who released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Dabney decided to manufacture the game.\" - Wikipedia",

See that little number with the three dots in the upper-left hand corner of the screen? Yep, that's the one. Kill a blue enemy and it turns blue. Kill another one and you've made two. One more and congrats, you've just completed a chain! So now it should read \"1\" and be grayed in. Now kill three more enemies of a certain color and bam! Two-chain. I think you get the idea.

A small cavern, surrounded by rock, overlooks the shoreline.

    "descriptionHtml": "<strong class=\"bbc\">ANOTHER IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> A wonderful player named pixcalibur alerted me to a couple of breaking bugs in the game. These (hopefully) have been fixed. The stairs to the lower levels of 5 and 6 now work correctly, as does the Red MP bottle.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong> I've looked at all the feedback and made some serious improvements. First and foremost: the overworld map is now enabled. I've replaced all the classic music with new tunes composed by Spawn. There is now a three-stair warp that you can access after the third dungeon to help you get around, as well as a bunch of little changes and bug fixes, especially in Level 9. Many thanks to everyone on the thread who helped with their feedback and letting me know about what was and wasn't working.<br> <br> It’s a classic style quest with a few twists. There are lots of items to find, experience to gain, plenty of caves to explore, eight dungeons, each with a piece of the triforce and a basement full of magic and powerful equipment, and an underworld with mini-dungeons and the impregnable fortress of Ganon, captor of the princess Zelda. Get the gear, kill the bad guys, save the girl.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">New things to find and do …</strong><br> Many of the weapons and items from the various Legend of Zelda games are here, along with a host of new ones. There are now maps for the overworld and underworld to point you to the dungeons. In addition to your regular bow and arrows, there are a double- and triple-shot crossbow that are a bit slower, but much more powerful, a whip that can stun in front of and behind Link, and seven magic spells—each with two levels of power:<br> <br> A Drop of Life (red) – A cheap way to heal a bit between stops at the fairy’s pond<br> Dragon’s Breath (orange) – Burn your way past your enemies with firey breath<br> Enhancer (yellow) – Give your sword a boost to cut through your opposition<br> Stunner (green) – Need a moment to think? Stop your enemies in their tracks<br> Zelda’s Faith (blue) – Protect yourself against the strongest of foes<br> Abei’s Gift (purple) – Are your wallet, quiver, and bomb bag a little too empty?<br> Link’s Wrath (grey) – Crushing damage, and in it’s most powerful form, a vital boost too!<br> <br> No matter how you take down your enemies, they each provide a little experience. As you rack up the levels, your maximum HP and MP will go up too, as well as your ability to carry supplies.<br> Within each dungeon, the dungeon boss holds the item you’ll need to access both the basement and the next dungeon. The items you’ll find in the basement aren’t necessary to complete the quest, but they’ll make things much easier.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">A note on magic …</strong><br> Magic plays a big part in this quest. While you only start with a little bit of MP and a single spell, in time you’ll become a powerful wizard in addition to a dominant fighter. When you cast a spell, a little time has to pass before you can cast another. A bar will appear beneath your MP counter that will let you know when you’re ready to cast again. As you build levels and find upgrades, you will be able to cast spells much more rapidly.",

A lot of overworld locations have moved, in fact probably the only thing that hasn't really changed is the Wooden Sword's location, and maybe a few secret rupee locations I was too lazy to move around.<br> <br> I know this doesn't really measure up to what Shoelace and co. have made, but it's the first quest I've managed to finish, so that makes it kind of important to me, even if I didn't have to design an entirely brand new overworld. (If I do a remake, I won't be doing a brand new overworld, but it will definitely have a lot more changes.)<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">--Update-- (November 30, 2013)</strong><br> <br> -Nerfed Stalfos 2's sword beam damage. Authenticity can bite me, I feel like this will make the quest a bit more approachable.<br> -Moved the location of the Cross.<br> -Added in new music, as opposed to the usual Z1 tunes.<br> -White Sword sprite returned to its original state to avoid confusion.<br> -Removed/filled in some caves that were empty. (hopefully all of them, I think I got all of them.)<br> -Added in the missing Heart Container and moved another to a location that I feel is less annoyingly obscure.<br> -Level 1's map and compass changed locations.<br> -Put a shop with bombs near Level 1. This is probably the most important thing I've done.<br> -Both changed and added some advice on the Overworld.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">--Update-- (January 18, 2014)</strong><br> <br> -Fixed a bug where an important staircase wouldn't appear on the overworld.<br> -Fixed some doors in Level 7 that made it impossible to complete otherwise.",

Before each dungeon you can get at least one additional heart if you look hard enough. This quest's difficulty is significantly migitated if you keep yourself healthy.<br> - Try using all of your items. If you try and treat this quest's combat like a lot of other quests (Sword+Boomerang everything, etc...), you're going to be in for a rude awakening.

Here is the list of things that were updated in this version:<br> - Replaced the Blue Tunic dungeon with a new minigame (You still get the Blue Tunic from it)<br> - Replaced the entirety of the final boss into something <strong class=\"bbc\">much</strong> shorter and enjoyable.<br> - Took out the 4-refill potions (including the free ones) and inserted regular potions to balance difficulty.<br> - Took out the Level 3 sword in order to balance the difficulty better, but replaced it with another useful item.<br> - Completely changed the 7th floor of the Music Tower into something shorter and less repetitive.<br> - Nerfed the Red Tunic in order to balance the difficulty.<br> - Added a <strong class=\"bbc\">bonus dungeon</strong> that gives out some rewards and a special secret for 100% the game.<br> - Changed some common Midi's into more unique Midi's.<br> - Added an NPC that travels around, gives trivia, and provide hints on puzzles.<br> - Edited the bosses of L3 so that it's easier to fight them and that they don't do mandatory damage.<br> - Tweaked the boss of L2.<br> - Numerous, <strong class=\"bbc\">numerous</strong> bugfixes.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">QUEST DETAILS:</strong><br> Lost Identity consists of one overworld, four dungeons, a few minidungeons, a bonus dungeon (recently added), and 6-8 hours of gameplay. This quest focuses a whole lot more on gameplay than on story, so please keep that in mind. I hope you enjoy!",

If you break a rule, you'll just die in the game and you'll also be told which rule you broke. Make sure to not break the rules. As new rules come into play, the quest slowly gets more and more challenging.<br> <br> Many of the rules make for some awkward, weird or funny situations, which you need to treat as an extra challenge to the quest. If you still find this really easy to beat, there is a really difficult endgame bonus dungeon, just for you. You will also get a notification and a 100% mark in your subscreen when you have completed the quest and collected everything there is to find. Nothing is permanently missable, you can get every item even after beating the final boss and seeing the credits.<br> <br> <span><strong class=\"bbc\">Update:</strong></span><br> Finally, a long awaited(?) update is out, fixing the biggest issues, so I can be happy with this quest.<br> <br> - The worst rules have been replaced with better ones.<br> - Now featuring controlled randomness, to give you rules based on a difficulty rotation.<br> - Added options at the beginning. You can now play without rules, or with more frequent rules or start with all rules active!<br> - Extra minutes are changed to give you 2 minutes, but are placed more carefully.<br> - Improved final boss.<br> - And minor changes here and there.",

Later areas can still be tricky though.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>Eiyuu contains 4 to 6 main levels (it's...weird to explain) and a number of secrets that will probably be classified as \"too many.\" There is also an experimental karma system that will keep track of items the player may have taken illegitimately from others. The karma system no longer affects any ending. Boss battles are not this game's strong suit but there are a few good ones courtesy of Moosh.</span></span><br> <br> <span><span>There is a small side legend revolving around 5 \"mega-tier\" secrets you can find in the game. Some of the higher-end secrets become increasingly abstract, but all solutions are intended to be logical and have in-game hints.

You can access this passageway after obtaining the slingshot.<br> - A portal shortcut from the main overworld to the Lon Lon Ranch has been added. This can be accessed after obtaining the candle.<br> - A shortcut to Gly'cov Mountain has been added. This is avaiable as soon as you get the flippers. In fact, it was there before, but it required the hammer. Now, it just requires the flippers.<br> - In a cave system on the way to level 2, a room full of portals has been adjusted.<br> - All present Stalfos now die instantly to fire just like their past counterparts.<br> - It is no longer possible to obtain the Upgraded Wand without the Aspected Wand.<br> <br> <br> Dungeon Changes:<br> <br> LEVEL 1:<br> Recieved a lot of changes. In its original design, it recieved a lot of criticism for the swamp caverns close it being part of the dungeon.<br> While I liked the idea of the dungeon being built into the entire swamp, I decided to scrap that idea for dungeon completion. The dungeon still is connected<br> to the swamp caverns, but it is NOT required for completion.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - New color pallette<br> - New music<br> - You no longer have to leave the dungeon to complete it. As such, the way to complete it has changed.<br> - Now contains an Heart Container Piece.<br> - Most traps have been removed from level 1.<br> <br> LEVEL 2:<br> This dungeon was redone in the last patch, so almost nothing changed. This change, even though small, will reduce the only bit of backtracking that I believed annoying for a completionist.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - One of the Heart Container Pieces in level 2 has been removed.This was the HCP that required blowing up a wall on the lowest floor of the dungeon.<br> <br> <br> LEVEL 3:<br> After the shortcut added in the last patch, level 3 was in a good spot. However, feedback yielded that the mini-boss was too difficult in his 2nd and 3rd iterations so adjustments were made.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - Outside of the dungeon, a switch was added to lower the barrier to the dungeon.<br> - The 2nd and 3rd iteration of the mini boss now deals slightly less damage and has had their respective hp reduced by 1/3.<br> - The 3rd iteration of the mini boss now takes full damage from the sword.<br> <br> LEVEL 4:<br> I always believed level 4 to be an excellent puzzle dungeon. The only aspect that deemed annoying, was the occasional dark rooms due to having to swap items so much.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - Level 4 no longer contains any dark rooms.<br> <br> LEVEL 5:<br> This was always one my favorite dungeons, but for some reason, it was always one of the most hated. The dungeon had 4 entraces all over Gly'cov that you would complete in phases.<br> With the following changes though, the dungeon will now only have 2 entrances where the main entrance is the only one that is important. You will have no reason to exit the dungeon once you enter it now<br> and if you do, it will be to buy potions which is now conveniently placed outside of the second entrance. With the change to level 1 and 5, now the only dungeon you have reason to leave is<br> Level 2, which makes sense due to its easy and convenient location.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - New music<br> - The dungeon no longer has multiple entrances. It just has two, but you complete the whole dungeon by going in the one main entrance.<br> - The areas that you used to have to travel to now contain optional prizes.<br> <br> LEVEL 6:<br> This has, and will always be, been my favorite dungeon in the game. Not only is it full of puzzles, it has a high level of challenge. As such, I did not feel it warranted any real changes.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - The music in Level 6 has changed.<br> <br> LEVEL 7:<br> This level is designed for you to be aware of your surroundings, but primarily as a battle oriented dungeon. With the change to ice, the dungeon feels smoother in addition to me deciding that<br> I strongly dislike dark rooms. As such, this dungeon will see those removed.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - All dark rooms have been removed from Level 7.<br> - The music for level 7 has changed.<br> <br> LEVEL 8:<br> This dungeon is unique and serves as a great test of your battle ability before entering level 9. I did not feel it warranted any changes, but felt the original music was slightly unfitting.<br> <br> Change list:<br> - The music for level 8 has changed.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\"></strong></div></div><strong class=\"bbc\"> </strong></div><br> <br> <br> <br> The Legend of Zelda: Flow of Time (Remastered) is a fully upgraded and re-envisioning of my original quest, the Legend of Zelda: Flow of Time. The remake hopes to bring forth exciting gameplay and puzzles that are reminiscent of the Gameboy Zelda games, in particular, the Oracle of Seasons &amp; Ages. It is my hope that even those who played the original, this will provide a truly new and unique gaming experience. Thanks the tremendous power of ZC 2.5 versus 2.10, there are so many additions to the game, such as:<br> <ul class=\"bbc\"><li>Unique Dungeon Masters for every dungeon.</li><li>Sidequests</li><li>Scripts to make the game feel more like a Zelda game</li><li>and much more!</li></ul> In addition, my graphical ability has improved substantially, which will make the beautiful world of Gly'cov come alive.

The sages have sealed away the Triforce in the remote land of Gly'cov and when an evil magician in Hyrule heard of this news, he traveled to Gly'cov.

    "descriptionHtml": "This quest was once a mere place to test how my ripped Catlevania tiles would look with LoZ sprites and stuff, nothing more. But then, I stumbled upon BlueKnight`s script showcase videos on YouTube and amazed what ZC scripts can do! An interesting but non-promising idea was sparked in my mind: What if I put Link into Castlevania, complete with sidescrolling. Back in the time when I wasn`t good at scripting, I have posted a quite ambitious script request: Castlevania-syled staircases. Chances of fulfilling that wish were really slim...<br>And after a pair of weeks I got a response from a guy nicknamed Grayswandir. He posted a giant piece code that, judging by comments, looks like a custom sideview engine. With stars mechanic. After installing it into the quest, I got a almost working staircases! Almost because there were a lot of bugs and glitches that limit creativity with new engine. After a couple of iterations, testing and bug-fixing, the engine was brought to at least usable state. And then Grayswandir disappeared without trace, leaving me with a half finished quest.<br>I have opened quest project page to search for new scripters to help me on my way. Of course, posted a few screenshots and a 4-stage demo. ZoriaRPG had tried to help me with scripting. But everything turns out to be either horribly buggy or done in wierd ways. The only good thing he did was a flashing effect for Rosario item pickup. By the time Zoria left the project, all 8 planned stages were almost finished design wise. At least entire quest was playable from start to ending, even tough a lot of stuff was missing. With the lack of contibutors on scripting side the project was put on hiatus for long time.<br>But I have found a topic made by BobbyLight. It has a Zscript coding IDE plugin for a text editor called Rtext. And then a guy nicknamed Kurt91 posted a work-in-progress script: Beginneer`s custom boss kit. While testing it for glitches, I have accidentally opened the script file in Zscript editor and it was nicely formatted and commented. It sparks my incentive to start learning scripting. After reading Saffith`s scripting tutorials several times I started to practice in scripting, starting from wierd things, like a wand that throws giant boulders. And discovered that extending Lweapon`s sprite is a good basis for whip. After writting and compiling script, I found out it`s just good enough to be in the quest. This sparked a new \"life\" for my quest.<br>The \"golden age\" of scripting has begun. I have done a lot of work in terms os scripting (stdCombos.zh, stdWeapons.zh, candelabra script and lots of other work). When I posted screenshots featuring some of my Castlevania subweapons (notably Axe and Holy Water), Zoria was amazed on how fast I have learned scripting. This gained me more than enough motivation to lift the project off hiatus and install all my related scriptwork. Also I have reverse-enginnered Grayswandir`s sideview engine (this was easy, thanks for comments) and fixed pretty much all it`s bugs. The learning of ghost.zh allowed me to script CV enemies completely from scratch, while discovery of the fact, that changing of npc-&gt;OriginalTile on the fly does wonders, allowed me to simplify enemy animation routines.<br>The rest was a pice of cake: odds and ends, bug-fixing, beta test and then release.",

    "informationHtml": "The Islands of Zelda is my first official, full-size quest. It takes place in an area other than Hyrule. Rather than having mountains as the main barrier, like in most other Zelda games, water is the main boundary in this quest. For this quest, I've created my own graphical style that I call \"Modified Classic\". Note: I chose \"Story-driven\" for the Quest Genre, but it has a big, healthy serving of \"NES-style\" mixed in with it!",
    "descriptionHtml": "- The whole idea behind this quest is that I'm tired of mountains being the main obstacle to reaching other areas. Why not make water the main obstacle and hide the flippers in a later level? So, Link starts out on one island and will explore many islands throughout this quest. Oh yeah, one clue I'll give you is that the raft is in the 1st dungeon, not a later dungeon, because you need it to visit all the other islands.<br> - For this quest, I've created my own graphical style by enhancing the Classic graphics, using over twice as many colors, and including some needed Link-to-the-Past-style graphics (which I greatly added to, BTW) to make what I call the Modified Classic tileset, though not a released tileset (yet).<br> - Since this is technically a Classic-style quest, I tried to use as many of the NES room types as possible. Don't be surprised to find a secret door that ends up being a door repair! (Don't be scared to look for secrets, though; I kept \"door repair\" types to a minimum. For example, the first island has plenty of secrets on it and none of them are nasty, I promise you.)<br> - This quest is being made using ZC version 2.10 for a couple of reasons: because that's how it began, and also because I wanted to learn ZC's full capabilities before learning scripting or having all the bells and whistles that came with version 2.5 (even though I have dabbled in 2.5 a bit since I started this quest).<br> - This quest uses 2 overworld maps, and, just to give you an early hint, I made the outside edges of the maps scroll-warp to the opposite side! (Of course, you'll need the flippers before you can find this out in-game.) This is to give the effect that (most) sailors lose their way and can't find their way home after arriving. (But of course Link should make it back to Hyrule after he finds Zelda. At least, I'm sure they'll find a way...)<br> - That being said, though, there are more than 2 \"overworld\" type maps. You'll see what I mean after you beat level 8.<br> - There are at least 9 dungeons, but many surprises to be found, to include a number of side-dungeons and caves in which Link will find useful items.<br> - If you're an explorer-type of game player, then this is definitely the quest for you!<br> - <strong class=\"bbc\">***</strong>By the way, <strong class=\"bbc\"><u>BE FOREWARNED: My Intro is LONG</u></strong> due to an extensive back-story. I apologize for this up front, but I'm a storyteller, so that's how it worked out. <strong class=\"bbc\"> IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE EXTENSIVE BACK-STORY, SKIP THE INTRO.***</strong> (Just thought I'd tell you up front in case you're the type to jump right into the action.)<br> <br> --- UPDATE --- (10/15/2014)<br> Included in this update:<br> - New midi for level 3 (same song, different version), courtesy of EddyTheOliveira<br> - A few bugfixes regarding combo placement, layers, and continue/spawn squares (blue/green squares)<br> - Redesigned a problem screen in level 6<br> - Fixed a missing burn flag on Serpento Island (for a secret)<br> Updated info on this database entry:<br> - Added tip about bombs in dungeon rooms (added as #4;

    "storyHtml": "(<u>Watch the in-game introduction in the quest to get the <em class=\"bbc\">whole</em> story</u>.

In the back-story of Zelda 2, Xanthis is the one who controlled the magician that cast a sleep spell on Zelda. Many years after Link awakened Zelda, Xanthis was able to make a stable clone of Ganon and taught him all that happened to the original Ganon. Fueled with knowledge of the past, the Ganon clone succeeded in kidnapping Zelda.<br> Before Link had time to act, Ganon and his minions boarded a ship and sailed to the far east. Link got help from Captain Mido, the captain of Hyrule's shipping fleet, and pursued. This quest starts right after lightning hits Link's ship and he awakens on the sandy beach of an island.",

It only has some N00bish attempts for creating something like weather effects.<br> <br> This quest is something between Dungeon Romper and Story-driven. Since I can't script and am not too smart with puzzles it's a bit enemy heavy though it does have some riddles (with weird solutions at times).

The bonus dungeon is nearly as big as the Overworld and consist of 9 parts, each with a special item.<br> I packed a bunch of wave files in the quest so even with the rather big size, it's more due them, not actual playing content.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">Little Update</strong>: Enabled Overworld Map and renamed since it seem to have confused some people.

The rest is pretty straight, just go where you weren't before. Later levels are on the way north.<br>5. You have more HC/P than you need, as long as you find them. When you maxed you should avoid any coming because you might need to pay with a lot of blood at some point.<br>6. Your Equipment to be good is very important so look for secrets. I also wouldn't attempt anything beyond part 2 of the bonus dungeon without the best gear available in normal game, even though, most of it can be accessed after getting the latest level items.<br>7. You start/continue with 50% health so better use save points and Farore's Wind, the S-points are usually hidden around main dungeons.

    "descriptionHtml": "It is a typical Zelda style game with basic overworld exploration (ne main overworld and 3 mini overworlds),<br>8 main dungeons, with a final dungeon,<br>several mini dungeon,<br>Max health is 20 hearts with 36 heart pieces scattered around the world.<br>Basic standard ZC items.<br>Minor scripting (Still learning how to make and use them properly).<br><div class=\"bbc_spoiler\"> <span class=\"spoiler_title\">Spoiler</span> <input type=\"button\" class=\"bbc_spoiler_show\" value=\"Show\"> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler_wrapper\"><div class=\"bbc_spoiler_content\"><br>UPDATE (12/18/17): This update provides more enemy balancing, bug fixes, and various text error that were brought to me attention. Thanks to Pixcalibur for helping out with these updates.<br>UPDATE (11/16/17): This update provides a lot of cosmetic clean-up of the quest, bug fixes, and other various things that were pointed out to me by Secret French Fry and Deathrider365's LPs.<br>UPDATE (05/01/16): This update pertains to problems and errors that were found in Melee Wizard's play through of the quest. Fixed some of the tiles errors and clean up of the over-world and enemies. Second cleaned up text errors that I probably created fixing other ones. Third the hardest part doing an overhaul on the last boss and making the player have more interaction with him and kind of guide him to the phase you where he is vulnerable. I tried to get this done after SCKnuckles play through and in the last update, but was having some problems with it being to random and still not selecting the path where he would be vulnerable more frequently. We corrected the some of the graphics errors that was not showing up in the final boss fight. \"Even the nasty fire gleelok at the end has been modify to be more fair\". We appreciate the feedback and error notifications to help improve this quest for everyone to play and enjoy.<br>UPDATE (02/01/16): This update pertains to all of the issues that were brought to my attention during SCKnuckles LP of the quest and made some changes to address the frustrating problems with the quest and clean up of the quest in general. Dreaded spelling/grammar errors are always looming but we caught a good amount of them, did a clean up of the enemies and balanced them more to be fair and i will try to lay off the bats next quest. Added some hints and minor rework to the levels to make them less frustrating and removed a lot of dark rooms in the quest but some still will exist (Just the not necessary ones). Did some minor tweaks to the final boss but it is still a work in process and will be releasing an update with his changes at a later date when i can complete him to my liking and past the testing (he is a 2.10 style boss and he is very delicate and breaks easy).<br>UPDATE (11/09/15): Well with more bugs and typos brought to my attention I decided to release an update correcting those. One big problem was the 5th floor of the tower with the hammer switch puzzle causing the player to get stuck, I replaced the puzzle with a more user friendly version of the puzzle, corrected some typos they we missed, and even done some minor nerfs to some of the enemies in the game to balance them a bit more. Thanks to SCKnuckles currently LP of the quest (currently at level 6), it helped us quite a bit to find the more elusive problems/bugs. I was going to release an update after he finished the LP but he broke a puzzle that I had to release an update to correct that problem.<br>UPDATE (08/26/15): A few More Broken Warps were fixed and boy it is hard to find all these after they break especially when they worked before and then stop working. I also fixed a game shop problem where a door is supposed to open after you pay the guy the money and not always be open. Last but not least cleaned up some of the graphics in various places, but nothing major to make a huge impact on the game itself.<br>UPDATE (08/18/15): In my process on adding newer scripts for some unknown reason the warps in level got scrambled and had to redo all of them to point to there proper location and still looking into how this happened since all of the script testing were more of cosmetics and appearances. Everything worked in testing and I was not getting the warp glitches until SofaKing pointed them out in level one. This version has the corrected warps for level one and hope this does not happen again in future levels.<br>UPDATE (08/15/15): This update is more of cosmetic one with addition some more scripts and cleaned up those goofy wizrobe fairy spawners that people mistake as enemies and tried to kill them. I cleaned up some graphical errors that I missed combing through the quest last time and cleaned up some very bad fights and positioning of enemies (this one will never end since the enemies know how to break this every time and there will always be new ones I missed).<br>UPDATE (05/08/15): Fixed a few bugs with some of NPC not talking and ladder issues in level 7 addressed, along with a few other graphics and minor glitches. weakened a few of the normal enemies and bosses reducing heath and damage a bit to make it a bit easier and less annoying to the player. Added a shortcut back to the amulet cave and a hint (to look for items before entering the dungeon) for level 6 to make it more friendlier to the player.<br>UPDATE (04/26/15): Redesigned level 2, and it has a completely new fresh feel to it and much less annoying. Fixed a few discovered typos that escaped our grasp last time. Fixed and made a few graphics edits and minor level modifications but nothing to big to change the scape of the level drastically.<br>UPDATE: (02/01/15): Made all keys level specific to prevent key carry over and possible breaking the game, modified some graphics and level designs a bit, and minor bug fixes.<br>UPDATE: (12/31/14): Fixed GFX/Tile errors in lvl5, and ladder bugs in the over world, modified the drop rate of arrows in arrow mini game increased the drop rate, added additional hints in the game, and made minor changes to the blocks in level 2 to note that you need the gauntlets to push.<br>UPDATE: (10/30/14): Fixed bad warps and GFXs especially the one in level 5 that was noted by Patgarret. Modified other small things made potions cheaper in the quest and minor bug fixes.<br>UPDATE: (10/20/14): Fixed a dead swim warp on the overworld that was discovered by GhostKnight22 and various other small things.<br></div></div> </div>",

The quest rule \"Can select A-button item on the subscreen\" is enabled in this quest, so in theory you can use two different items at once if you really wanted to. However, I would recommend keeping the feather on A and all the other items on B to make the quest a bit easier, but that's just me.<br> <br> UPDATE 1: Fixed a few bugs including some ladder issues and completely redone the subscreen so that linear navigation is no longer a problem.

    "descriptionHtml": "This is a quest that has taken me a little over seven years of on and off work to complete. Since it was started so long ago, this is a 2.10 quest. My goal with this quest was to show off the true capabilities of the 2.10 editor, using features and tricks I had seen only in the best quests, as well as numerous I came up with on my own. I never updated this to a 2.5 quest because I felt it would ruin the magic. No freeform combos, no custom enemies, no scripts; just some good old fashion creative design. (That being said, the quest has been tested to be fully playable in 2.5.)<br><br>In this quest you climb a large, 10 floor tower. Each floor is its own level, and each floor has its own gimmick. For example, on the first floor, there is uncrossable water and patches of sand. After finding a magic warp, the water freezes and becomes crossable, but the sand becomes impassable rocks. You must switch between these states in order to find your way to the next floor. The floors start off simple: Zelda 1 style dungeons with basic gimmicks, but as you climb, the floors start to become free-form, and the gimmicks become more and more complicated.<br><br>In fact, reaching the ninth floor of the tower is really only the half way point through the quest. The ninth floor is special in that it is a quest within a quest – it has its own overworld, cave systems, towns, citizens, and eight full main dungeons to complete, alongside a couple side dungeons and mini-games. There are numerous trade quests, a day/night system, custom fights, and the mysteries behind the tower begin to make themselves known. Expect many different areas and atmospheres, and lots of open exploration.<br><br>Of course, for those looking for a little something extra, there are a number of secret dungeons hidden throughout the tower. Not only do these dungeons net you extra heart containers, but finding and completing all the secret levels unlocks the true ending to the quest, and allows you to unravel the mysteries surrounding the tower.<br><br>On the whole, this quest is all about dungeon exploration and puzzle solving, and it puts many interesting twists on item uses and area themes. Expect 15-20 hours of gameplay, with a total of somewhere around 25 complete levels to explore.",

However, what he finds is more than he could have expected: powerful, menacing foes, mysterious helpful writings from a Wise Old Man, and prophecies of a certain death should he continue to climb to the top of the tower.<br><br>As he climbs the tower, he suddenly finds himself in a mysterious land which leads him to question his journey. Who are the people in this land, and how did they get here? What is the purpose of the tower, and how is it linked to this strange land? Who is the Wise Old Man, and what could possibly bring certain death in the tower? And most importantly, will he be able to return to the tower and make it To The Top?",

Who is the man threatening the island with death? How is he tied to the island? And perhaps most importantly, is there anything that can stop him? With three different endings and multiple plot twists, Light of the Heavens offers a thrilling story from start to finish.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<em class=\"bbc\"><strong class=\"bbc\">Version 1.2 Release Information:</strong></em><br> This is a newer version of the quest. It includes the long awaited, and hyped-for-years Hero Mode. Zelda fans can rejoice at last. Hero mode brings along a few new challenges, including:<br> <br> - Tougher enemies! Most have more HP, and do more damage, or some combination of both.<br> - Some items have been replaced, and moved around. You can now find the Blue Ring.<br> - The only way to find hearts is in bushes, or pots, Enemies don't drop them anymore unless it's a mini boss!<br> - No more fairies, and there's only one potion.<br> - New overworld palette (gasp! It's so HD 3D), and new (old, actually) dungeon music.<br> - There is no list of items in Hero Mode. Figure it out yourself!<br> <br> <br> <em class=\"bbc\"><strong class=\"bbc\">Version 1.1 Release Information</strong></em><br> This is a one dungeon quest, but not a joke quest.<br> With that out of the way, you can expect a nice 30-40 minute romp through a dungeon of moderate difficulty. It is designed with slightly varying paths with speed-running in mind. I actually made this a long time ago, and had the intention of making a 'full' four dungeon quest, but, well, reasons happened, and I quit working on it :heh:. I figured I'd polish it up a bit, and go ahead and make it an official release since people seemed to like the demo I released a few years back, but has probably been lost to the ages.<br> <br> Features:<br> - One dungeon. (wow)<br> - Four Overworld Screens. (gasp!)<br> - A House! (I can't believe it)<br> - A few of Link's items. (get out)<br> <br> <br> Advantages over original release:<br> - Has more of a beginning, and end. It's not just a dungeon, that warps to its entrance when you beat it.<br> - Fixed a lot of minor bugs, and discrepancies. It plays a lot smoother now. These include issues with the over-under bridges, and mostly things with layering.<br> - Balanced certain elements a little better. Shuffled around some items, and added in the magic shield.<br> - You can now carry 15 bombs, instead of 8 from the start.<br> <em class=\"bbc\">-<strong class=\"bbc\"> </strong></em><em class=\"bbc\">Grass in the overworld will ensure you never run out of bombs, or rupees.</em><br> - Both quests are unpassworded. If you want to look around, go for it. Just please be respectful, and don't steal stuff from it. I don't care if you ask to use something though if you want, I'll most likely say yes. There's a lot of extra stuff not seen in the game, like some other stuff I was working on that didn't get finished.<br> <br> A link to the old thread has been added for those curious. Everything within though is defunct since this release.<br> I hope you enjoy this small release from me. Happy New Year! :)",

It is always possible to lower the difficulty in-game (but not increase it) so I recommend you start in normal mode to see how you're doing before you choose a lower difficulty. Hero mode is extremely punishing and is only recommended to players who have beaten the quest in normal mode beforehand.<br> <br> Estimated gameplay time: around 20 hours.

    "descriptionHtml": "First off, a disclaimer: this quest is honestly not up to my own standards, but I have been asked many times to release it, so I’ve decided to finally do so. I made it in about a week when 2.5 was officially released in order to acclimate myself to the new editor and learn about new features. Thus you should not expect anything great or very well-polished, but it should still provide a solid experience.<br><br>This quest features:<br>-One 8x8 overworld, and eight small dungeons.<br>-Somewhat non-standard and non-linear progression: you can do some dungeons in different orders, and the dungeon rewards vary from new items to opening new areas.<br>-Overworld and characters that change as the quest goes on (make sure to revisit characters that tell you to do things; after you’ve done them, they may have, for example, opened a shop.)<br>-Interesting use of the enemy editor; many enemies have an item they are weak to, and boss weaknesses have been twisted to change the classic fights. Some of the later bosses are admittedly fairly tough if you don’t know what to do, so make sure to try all of your tools (super bombs are especially good.)<br>-Lots of pointless counters on the subscreen (damage taken, enemies killed, etc.)<br>-The Black Potion.",
    "storyHtml": "Upon returning home after defeating Ganon, Link finds his house has been occupied by Moblins. In fact, the whole country has been overrun! In anger, Link does whatever it takes to get rid of these pesky Moblins, including burning down a forest, robbing a bank, draining a lake, and possibly worse.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "The secrets and dungeon design mentality is fairly classic in nature. This means you should keep the following in mind:<br>-Keys are often hidden behind unmarked bomb walls, in grass/bushes, in stairs that appear from directional push blocks, under bombable cracked tiles, and the like. The dungeons are fairly small, so brute force searching for these secrets should not be too horrible.<br>-Every dungeon is consists of a rectangle of rooms. You can use this to help you narrow down where to search.<br>-The whistle drains water in many places. Try not to forget about this.<br><br>As mentioned above, enemies generally have weakness. In the case of bosses, it is usually the dungeon item (regardless of what they are conventionally weak to – for example, Manhandlas only take damage from the boomerang in this quest, and different colored Gohmas take damage from different projectiles.)<br><br>Make sure to go back and visit NPCs after finishing dungeons; they may have new things to say, or better, they may have opened a shop or gambling game.<br><br>Try to be somewhat stingy with ammo; it can be a bit difficult to come by at times.<br><br>At the very very end of the quest, you will have to kill some like-likes.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Legend of Lana is, if it wasn't obvious, a quest that got inspired by Hyrule Warriors.<br> After seeing the NES overworld in that game and the sprites, I got quite inspired, and asked myself: What would it be like if you could play as Lana in Zelda 1?<br> <br> This, is what I came up with! It's one of those \"third\" quests, that uses an overworld heavily inspired by Zelda 1, but still features some distinct changes, and most important of all; New dungeons!<br> <br> What to expect:<ul class=\"bbc\"><li>8 Triforce dungeons!</li><li>A final level with an epic showdown!</li><li>Gameplay inspired by how Lana functions in Hyrule Warriors!</li><li>Shitty humour!</li><li>Puzzles!</li><li>Bathrobes!</li><li>Er, I mean, Batrobes!</li><li>Massive item and Enemy rebalance!</li></ul>Furthermore, Lana gameplay will function very different from how it usually is with Link, since item focus is very different. For example; There is not a single shield in the game, so dodging is more important than ever! Items that usually requires magic don't (wand, candle, etc). Likewise, items such as bombs and arrows have unlimited uses, just as in Hyrule Warriors. Of course, they have been rebalanced to work this way! For example, using bombs as a common weapon is now possible, since you'll never run out of them!<br> <br> Difficulty level will be around what you'd expect in the second quest, if I were to make an estimate. By PZC standards, that probably means the quest is a bit more on the easy side. The focus of the quest is to provide a challenge for most players, but not be particularly punishing if the player actually goes out of his or her way to find all the side quests/upgrades on the overworld!<br> <br> <br> Your quest to reclaim the triforce of power starts now!<br> <br> ----------------<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">Version 2.3 Change log:</strong><br> -&gt; The lens of insight now has added graphics to better reflect the on or off state.<br> -&gt; There is now a second shop that sells the lens of insight.<br> -&gt; Boosted range and projectiles on all three levels of the standard Special.<br> -&gt; Special ring recovers special at a faster rate. (Almost twice as fast.)<br> -&gt; There is now rather slow passive special generation. (Requires new save file to activate.)<br> -&gt; Version number on status screen is now in a less obvious and intrusive colour.<br> -&gt; There is now a recommendation to seek out the green tunic when you enter level 4. (It's at this point the game expects you to have it.)<br> -&gt; The arrow trigger in the lava area of the overworld was made more obvious as to what it was.<br> -&gt; Players are now told how many hearts they need to have in order to acquire the upgrades that require X amount of hearts.<br> -&gt; Players are now informed that you can't play money losing making game unless they can pay for the losing fee. (Though, as before, you can still attempt.)<br> -&gt; New enemy: Bat (L0): It's basically a regular bat with reduced movement speed and half health.<br> -&gt; Level 4's difficulty has been tweaked:<br> --&gt; Reduced amount of shooters in rooms that had more than one.<br> --&gt; Replaced around half of the Bats in the dungeon with Bat (L0)<br> --&gt; Misc small changes and bug fixes in regards to enemy placements.<br> -&gt; Manhandla 1's base movement speed (all heads alive) was reduced slightly.<br> -&gt; The room where you can get a free lens of insight now forces you to walk into it and closes until you clear the encounter.<br> -&gt; A few new overworld secrets has been added.<br> -&gt; Added a really obscure overworld secret<br> <br> And here's the big change:<br> -&gt; Bombs and Enhanced Bombs base damage has been boosted by 1.<br> -&gt; Power Bombs let you place more than one bomb on the same time.<br> -&gt; All bow firing velocity has been increased.<br> -&gt; New bomb and arrow systems.<br> --&gt; Bombs and arrows are now finite, but re-stock quickly over time. (Prevents excessive spamming but let's you use them freely.)<br> --&gt; Bomb and arrow upgrades now increases the max cap of bombs and arrows you carry.<br> -&gt; Bombs and Arrows are now shown on the HUD.<br> -&gt; New shop added that sells upgrades that increases how fast ammo is re-stocked. <strong class=\"bbc\">&lt;-(Unless you start a new file, you'll already have this!!!)</strong><br> Preview Video: <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9395043/Images/Project%20screenshots/Lana%202/NewArrowsAndBombs.mp4\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">https://dl.dropboxus...owsAndBombs.mp4</a><br> <br> -&gt; Dodongo had it's health increased to better match the new bomb damage.<br> -&gt; Made two previous unmovable blocks in level 1 pushable.<br> -&gt; There is now a marker on each of the special bars to signify when they are completely full.<br> -&gt; Potions renamed from colours to: Life potion, Special potion, Miracle potion.<br> -&gt; Reduction to wall masters in some rooms of level 9.<br> -&gt; Level 9 now features Firerobes replacing some enemies.

    "descriptionHtml": "Well How-de-do there, PureZC, it's been a while! How've you been? How're the wives? Won any good wars recently? I've been good, just enjoying feeling reasonably happy in my own skin for the first time in my life, and so on and so forth, it's pretty awesome. Anyways, I just dug myself up out of this here cave in the ground to present you with this little game here. Nothing special, it's been done before, but I thought that since ZC has come so far since 1.90 and 1.92, I might as well do it to pass some time. And I'm super sorry, but my writing is going to get boring and dry from here on out. I was in semi-history-student-mode when I wrote it, so it reads like that. A lot of it is common knowledge around here, but I wanted to be reasonably thorough. So let's get to it.<br><br><br>This introduction is for those who are not too familiar with BS Zelda, and/or those who enjoy a bit of video game history every now and then. If you are not one of these people, feel free to skip straight to the TL;DR at the end.<br><br>In 1995, Nintendo released the Satellaview, a peripheral for the Super Famicom, in Japan. As the name implies, the add-on was used to pick up satellite broadcast software for the Super Famicom, similarly to things like the Sega Channel for the Sega Genesis. While the attachment was never released outside Japan, it did quite well in its homeland, even while customers were being charged huge fees for the service.<br><br>During the Satellaview's life-span, there were several games developed specially for the add-on, many of them part of very familiar franchises. There was an F-Zero game for it, a Fire Emblem game, Dragon Quest, Harvest Moon, hell, even Sim City. Among these though were two Zelda games, one of which was aptly titled “BS The Legend of Zelda” – “BS” being short for “Broadcast Satellite.” BS Zelda, as fans have taken to calling it, was for all intents and purposes a scaled back remake of the first game in the series, albeit with some twists: The game was broadcast over the course of four weeks, being broken up into four episodes with certain objectives to complete in a fifty-minute time limit. On top of that, the game featured full voice acting and music, which was broadcast alongside the game data itself, to help move along the plot and to push players in a direction necessary to beat the game in the given time frame. The game's story was also slightly altered, with players playing not as Link, but as the mascots of “BS-X: The Story of the Town Whose Name Was Stolen,” the game/application cartridge used alongside the Satellaview to load games into the console's memory.<br><br>BS Zelda, as far as Nintendo is concerned, never saw the light of day after service for the Satellaview ended. Of course, it wasn't long before a ROM of the game was leaked onto the Internet. In its original dumped state, however, the game was not very playable, partially due to a combination of emulation issues, the timed nature of the game, and flat-out corrupted data, among other problems.<br><br>A vibrant community of Zelda fans, hackers, and other such enthusiasts soon cropped up with the mission of restoring these games to a playable state, a goal which while at this point in time has long since been technically achieved, is being pushed further and further all the time. Even our very own Armageddon Games had a part in that: That Romview utility packaged with Zelda Classic? That program was written by Phantom Menace, the creator of Zelda Classic, specifically for BS Zelda, over fifteen years ago. Similarly, the BS Zelda Homepage, which can be considered the core of the BS Zelda community, has a reasonably sized section on BS Zelda content in Zelda Classic. One member of the ZC community several years ago, Vel, even remade the entirety of the game in ZC back in 2004, which is what provided the inspiration for this little project.<br><br>Even today, the impact of BS Zelda on the Zelda Classic community is not only undeniable, but absolutely inescapable. Anyone who's ever even opened ZQuest in the past decade has most likely come across the term “BS” in regards to the Zelda series. There are innumerable enemies, combo types, quest rules, and so on within Zquest that refer to BS Zelda. Beyond that, virtually all of the most popular tilesets – Pure and Dance of Remembrance, for example – contain a large amount of graphics from BS Zelda.<br><br>As such, I only find it fitting that after so many years, with so many new additions to Zelda Classic, that someone should go ahead and remake the game once more, to show how far ZC has come as a game engine since Vel's own remake of it in 2004.<br><br><br>As a sort of TL;DR, here's the basics: This is a remake of BS The Legend of Zelda in Zelda Classic, because BS Zelda is important to ZC and all that, and because it was done before but ZC has come a long gosh darn way since then. The biggest omission here is the voice acting, which was only ever recorded in Japanese. It has been circumvented, however, with a couple changes to in-game text, and good ol' reliance on the player to explore and experiment.",
    "storyHtml": "Ever played the Legend of Zelda? Yes. You have. I'm fairly certain of it. This is pretty much that. Except like you play as the BS-X mascots and not Link, but I put an option to play as Link in here, so don't you worry your poor little heart.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "The game is broken up into four “weeks.” Each of these is fifty minutes long, starting at 0X:07, and ending at 0X:57 – This is how the game was broadcast.<br> <br> Over the course of the game, gameplay will occasionally halt at certain specific points and something will happen. Sometimes an item will be powered up in some way. Sometimes a fairy will appear. Sometimes all enemies on screen will be killed.<br> <br> The only times that the game will save is at the end of each week. Just as you couldn't stop a TV broadcast in the summer of 1995 and come back to it a few days later right where you left off, you can't just save the game in the middle of the thing here!<br> <br> You can, however, press the “Ex1” key to skip straight to the end of the week.<br> <br> The Map key, usually bound to the space bar, is used here for opening and closing your Objective Screen! This tells you what you should find by the end of the week. This is also the only way of pausing the clock, aside from pausing Zelda Classic as a whole.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Bringing up the normal subscreen will not stop time!</em></strong><br> <br> Wait, I need an actual tip and/or cheat listed here? Okay, here's one. At some point during the first week, a Heart Container will appear at the beach. You will only have about ten minutes to get it before it disappears.",

Also includes additional L2/L3/L4/L5 modified enemies, 3 new custom dungeon palettes, and a wide selection of new music ranging from rearrangements of LoZ/AoL/LttP classics to other medieval/RPG-styled games.",
    "descriptionHtml": "The Third Legacy is primarily based around the classic NES style of gameplay, meaning that while there may be some obscure secrets and item-based obstacles, there aren't any exceedingly convoluted puzzles or other devious trickery meant to stump the player for days on end. Progressing through the quest should be relatively straight-forward, in as much as the original NES game was ever straight-forward. In this regard, I've tried to make the quest accessible to players who may be familiar with the first 2 quests but new to custom quests, as well as players who've been custom-questing for a while.<br> <br> Similarly, the difficulty begins moderately easy, but gradually increases in distinct segments as the quest progresses. This doesn't only apply to challenges in battle, but to increasingly complex dungeon layouts as well. The first segment, The Green Lands, features distinctly classic NES gameplay, enemies, and items. It contains the first 3 dungeons, each of which requires an item from the previous one to access. The second segment, The Desert, adds magic and begins to introduce new ZC items to the gameplay, as well as steps up the enemy roster accordingly. It contains the 4th and 5th dungeons, each of which can be done in any order. The third segment, The Scorched and Frozen Lands, continues to introduce new ZC items, provide new weapon techniques, and unleash new enemies to battle. It contains the 6th and 7th dungeons, each of which can be done in any order. The fourth segment, The Underworld, dramatically raises the tension, and expects that you should have collected the majority of items and upgrades offered up to this point. It contains the 8th dungeon, as well as 3 Trial Caves. Finally, Ganon's Palace is an all-out death-match.<br> <br> Outside of this progression, however, are 3 Treasure Vault side-dungeons, 1 for each of the first 3 segments, in which you can gain powerful items - if you're willing to fight tooth and nail for them. These are optional, but highly recommended, as the items will significantly aid you for quite a while after attaining them.<br> <br> <span><strong class=\"bbc\">UPDATE - SEPTEMBER 08, 2019 - v1.2 RELEASED!</strong><br> <br> The following are a few of the most significant highlights.

A full list of detailed changes, including specific enemy and item stats, can be found in the text file.<br> <br> <span class=\"bbc_underline\">General:</span><br> * Multiple levels (DMaps) now compiled into single maps. Previously, each DMap had its own corresponding map; now, anywhere from 2 to 4 DMaps (and in one case, 7 DMaps) have been placed within single maps, using DMap offsets to replicate the original positioning. As a result, the map count has been reduced from 44 to 16, and the file size decreased by 599K. (This is strictly a matter of file organization and has no effect on gameplay.)<br> * MIDI file information reconfigured to display proper credits and instrumentation in \"Quest MIDI Info...\" listing.<br> * 2.50.2 compatibility confirmed.<br> <br> <span class=\"bbc_underline\">Gameplay:</span><br> * Wizzrobe Summoners limited. This is the primary reason for the v1.1 update. Previously, a single Summoner had the capacity to fill a screen to its 500-enemy limit, resulting in an incredulous flood of enemies if not dispatched immediately. Now, by modifying a series of Wizzrobe Bat Summoners to mimic the original Summoners, 40-enemy limits have been enforced on all summons, resulting in far more manageable challenges and far less system strain. Additionally, a number of summons have been weakened in a variety of ways, whether by moving slower, firing less projectiles, having less HP, splitting into fewer children, or becoming normal splitters rather than tribbles.<br> * Underworld difficulty level considerably decreased. It seems most players aren't into chaotic finales like I am, therefore the final third of the game has undergone major changes to keep the difficulty increase at a ramp rather than an exponential curve. Most enemies have had HP reductions between 15 - 40%, others have had step speeds slowed and attack damages decreased, and almost all enemies now have an adequate chance of a 3-heart drop upon death. Additionally, a majority of bosses from the second half of the quest have had HP and damage reductions (the BS-Zelda bosses in particular), and some now have new weapon weaknesses.<br> * Implemented Lejes' Fire Trail reduction script to reduce flame duration for fire-dropping enemies. Fire Zol flame duration reduced from over 10 seconds to under 6 seconds, now leaving a maximum of 4 trails behind them. Rooms with fire-dropping Patras vary from 4 to 8 seconds.<br> <br> <span class=\"bbc_underline\">Interface &amp; Interaction:</span><br> * Dungeon Maps now display full-color layouts with doors, locks, boss locks, entryways, and bombable walls visibly marked.<br> * Compass positions on each floor of Frozen Dungeon now indicate stairs leading to Triforce room.<br> * All fairy life-restoration rings are now life-and-magic-restoration rings.<br> * Cactus damages lowered by half.<br> * Old Man in Underworld entry-tree gives directions to the 3 Trial Caves.<br> * Enabled cheats. See text file (or \"Hints &amp; Cheats\" below) for hints.<br> <br> <span class=\"bbc_underline\">Items &amp; Equipment:</span><br> * Link isn't hurt by own fire weapons.<br> * Magic Shield now blocks flame attacks.<br> * Sword beams can now be fired down to 91% health (e.g with 6 hearts, beams fire at 5.25 hearts; with 16 hearts, at 14.5; with 24 hearts, at 21.75).<br> * Peril Ring/Peril Scroll now activate damage divisor/sword beam at 2 hearts rather than 1.<br> * Nayru's Love duration increased from 512 to 640; magic cost raised from 2 containers to 3 (originally 4).<br> * Black Ring damage divisor reduced from 16 to 12.<br> * Many significant item prices reduced by 25 - 50 rupees.<br> <br> <span class=\"bbc_underline\">Layout &amp; Visuals:</span><br> * Added slightly tweaked dirt/sand tiles to indicate whistle-blown staircases.<br> * Added darker stumps to indicate burnable trees in dungeons.<br> * Maps moved to earlier rooms in first four dungeons.<br> * Desert Dungeon &amp; Inferno Dungeon palette brightness/saturation moderately reduced; color casts slightly shifted.<br> * Recolored CSet 6 lava-water in Scorched Lands using CSet 8 to prevent sprite-palette-based color-shifts; smoothed animation.<br> * Added step-switch in Desert Dungeon to permanently raise tiles across hyper-spike room leading to boss segment.<br> * Blocked some segments of water in Underworld Dungeon/Cave of Life on which player could get stuck using Two-Way Ladder.<br> * Added the Winchester cave.</span></div></div> </div>",

It also has been updated to 2.5.2, so please play in that version or higher, or you'll likely run into compatibility bugs in the basement of level 2.<br> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler\"> <span class=\"spoiler_title\">Changelog</span> <input type=\"button\" class=\"bbc_spoiler_show\" value=\"Show\"> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler_wrapper\"><div class=\"bbc_spoiler_content\"><br> -New Moosh sprites, courtesy of Shane<br> -Balance changes to some techs<br> -Bonus dungeon bugfixes (finally)<br> -Miscellaneous polish stuff<br> -Two jokes</div></div> </div>",
    "storyHtml": "Long ago, the blood god Akuma and bear spirit Moosh waged a great war against each other. Knowing that he would be unable to attain victory, Moosh sealed the demon away with the help of a local village. Before leaving them to rest, Moosh promised that one day, when the seal on Akuma weakened, an avatar of Moosh would be born among them to stop the demon.<br><br>Years have passed since then. The peaceful village lived quietly and contently under the curse of Akuma, which prevented them from stopping without first smashing into something. But they managed. One morning, a youth Finnigan went out to meet with his friend Xaya, the daughter of the village's leader. She'd been troubled by her visions recently, dreams of Akuma breaking forth from the seal. But she'd had another vision, one of the Moosh statue at the town's center. Going off Xaya's vision, Finnigan touched the statue, causing it to slide away and reveal a hidden staircase.<br><br>Xaya's father explained to the youth that this meant he was the avatar of Moosh. Blessed with the power of free movement and the ability to temporarily transform himself into an incarnation of Moosh, it would be up to Finnigan to find the three Crystal Spring Bananas and stop Akuma from breaking free from his seal. Accepting this responsibility, Finnigan set out to find the three bananas.<br><br>But as Xaya's visions grow worse and worse, will he be able to find them in time?",

If you can't find any good techs, try playing Flappy Moosh or buying some feathers from the shop.<br><br>Potions are expensive, but help a ton.<br><br>The quest password is given out if you manage to beat the game in it's entirety, bonus dungeon included.",

    "descriptionHtml": "As the title suggests this is a simple quest. Since it is my first quest I decided to keep things simple, no scripting or layers, and try something more complex with a future quest. I also stuck with the original tile set. While I didn't make any new enemies I did soup up some of the existing enemies to make things a bit more challenging. This quest uses the standard 8 dungeons to get the Triforce pieces and a 9th dungeon to rescue Zelda from Gannon. Both the overworld and the dungeons get increasingly difficult as you progress. In the future I'd like to try other tilesets, scripting, and if I can figure out how, custom enemies but for now I hope you enjoy what I've made.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<span><span><span><br> After a few months, this project is finally complete. This project re-creates the first Legend of Zelda in the 2.5 version of the Classic tileset, as well as in the Koten set. This includes the first, and second quests. This quest is also unpassworded, so anyone is free to open it up, look around, and see how things where done in the first Legend of Zelda. You are also free to package this, and use it with you own ZC forks, now that ZC is open source. My goal is that this becomes a learning tool, and a pack-in for ZC.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">A bit about the development:</strong><br> I started a thread wondering if there was something like this that already existed. When there wasn't, I decided to take it upon myself to re-create the first game using 2.5's Classic tile set layout. I completely redrew the OW from scratch. The dungeons in the first quest where also re-created screen by screen. For the second quest, I imported the dungeon maps into the quest file, and replaced the tiles in the newer versions. This turned out to be faster, cause I didn't have to set screens up outside of their graphics. This was a learning experience for me, even.<br> <br> There were some additions, and changes that I've made to Koten, and even Classic to make this as faithful to the NES version(s) as possible, which I thought was kind of funny. Most of these are aesthetic changes.The new version of Classic uses animated water. When you drain the lake with the whistle, the drained water still animates, as it only changes the palette, this looked weird, so Classic got some stationary water for those screens. Koten had to have some similar water additions cause the drained lake screen secrets don't work outside of Classic properly.<br> <br> Here's some other random notes, and changes made for Koten.</span></span></span><ul class=\"bbc\"><li>Removed extra pixels from left/ right doors which made them look off next to the walls.</li><li>Corrected the dungeon template on the left side of the screen. This is still technically off, but it is better than it was. I don't feel like applying the template to every screen by hand, since the \"apply Template to all\" just doesn't work for whatever reason. This should be fully corrected in the second quest, and I might, MIGHT make an update later if I feel motivated to the first quest. It's just not that big of a deal.</li><li>Made the water solid.</li><li>Added palettes for Link's blue, red, and gold ring. (custom)</li><li>Added sprite c-sets for Aquamentus, Digdogger, Gleeok, and Ganon. (copied from elsewhere in the set)</li><li>Added \"Dry Lake\" Water tiles.</li><li>Changed Lv2 Moblins from that weird orange, to a blue c-set.</li><li>Added names to all d-maps, for learning purposes.</li></ul><span><span><span><br> If there any bugs (which there shouldn't be) please let me know so I can fix them ASAP.</span></span></span><br> <span><span><span><br> <span class=\"bbc_underline\"><span><strong class=\"bbc\">Updates:</strong></span></span></span></span></span><br> <span><span><span><br> Updated 4.15.16 (1.3)</span></span></span><ul class=\"bbc\"><li>Thanks to PureZC's kind staff, I am able to submit this to the database.

    "informationHtml": "After enjoying playing Yeto's Quest, I wanted to create a quest which provided many of the positive experiences I had while playing it, without any of the serious flaws many people found in the quest.",
    "descriptionHtml": "<a href=\"https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests&amp;id=458\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"\">Yeto's Quest</a> is a quest which is infamous for being one of the worst (at least one of the lowest rated) quests in the database. Nonetheless, it is a quest I quite enjoyed playing (and you can see why by reading <a href=\"https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=comments&amp;t=reviews&amp;id=17057\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"\">my review</a>.) I wanted to create a quest which allowed others to experience some of what I found so great about it while actually being playable and bug free. That being said, this is not just a remake or cleanup of Yeto's Quest; it is very much its own quest.<br> <br> Basically, you can expect a quest that requires a great deal of careful exploration and tricky puzzle solving. While there are single-room puzzles, many of the puzzles are much broader in scope. Much of your exploration will slowly teach you how the world works, and what you learn will help you discover the secrets you need to move forward. Combat in general is not very difficult, but the bosses are extremely challenging - the scripted battles in this quest have a more sophisticated AI than the typical pattern many scripted fights seem to follow. Enemies are cognizant of things like spacing and weapon range, and may make defensive moves instead of offensive ones. These combat experiences are meant as a battle of wits and involve careful thought and planning.<br> <br> This is a quest which aims to question typical conceptions of \"good design\" and \"bad design.\" There are numerous aspects of this quest which, out of context, would generally be considered \"bad design\" decisions; however, they are twisted in a way which not only subverts them, but, in my opinion, creates a unique, thought-provoking experience. The biggest mistake you can make while playing this quest is to assume anything based on traditional design decisions. There are plenty of points in this quest where you are intentionally given partial information in such a way that the typical extrapolation of this knowledge leads to completely false conclusions.<br> <br> That being said, this quest is not for everyone. Only people who are patient and can approach it with an open mind will be able to enjoy the quest. You will get stuck. You will be fooled. You will need to be careful and thorough. All these not because I enjoy causing people to suffer - it is quite the opposite: in overcoming more difficult challenges, greater satisfaction can be felt. These are intended to be true, mentally stimulating challenges, not cheap tricks or unfair rooms filled with death - brute force is not the answer.<br> <br> It is worth noting that this quest has a fairly significant amount of scripts for various mechanics and aesthetics. While most of the scripting is not completely in your face, it is good to keep this in the back of your mind since this means the quest may break typical ZC conventions.<br> <br> While the quest can easily be beaten in under two hours if you know what you're doing, a first playthrough will likely take over ten.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">WARNING:</strong> This is NOT a joke quest. This is a serious effort at creating an interesting and enjoyable quest; it took a little over two years to develop. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of humor, but don't go into this expecting a bunch of nonsense and memes.<br> <br> <br> Update (5/30/2016):<br> -Slightly lowered damage and HP for some boss fights.<br> -Fairy statues now refill bombs once you've found them.<br> -Made a extremely minor change that no one will ever notice.",

Furthermore, some additional content has been added to the game in the form of a couple of extra items and dungeons.<br> <br> <br> At it's heart, Legend of Lana is a quest that got inspired by Hyrule Warriors and the characters in it.<br> After seeing the NES overworld in that game and the sprites, I got quite inspired, and asked myself: What would it be like if you could play as Lana in Zelda 1? This is what the original Legend of Lana tried to be, going as far as using the original Zelda 1 overworld. In the DX edition of the quest a lot has been changed and expanded upon, including it's own overworld.<br> <br> Items and enemies in this quest function very different from Zelda 1 and most Zelda classic quests. For example, arrows work on most wizzrobes and darknutz (assuming you don't hit their shields). You'll also have an unlimited supply of bombs and arrows once you have acquired them, though with the caveat that you can't spam them too much as they are on a re-charge timer. Lana also doesn't carry a shield, so you'll have to dodge more projectiles compared to Link. But your main weapon is also a ranged projectile that can multi-hit, meaning that you don't need to get as close to strike most enemies.<br> <br> As of the DX version, this quest now comes with two difficulty levels: Normal and Hard. Normal is the main experience that this quest was crafted for, and as such is the recommended one. Hard is mainly for those who have beaten the DX version, as it offers enemies that deal double damage as well as larger and more complex dungeon layouts, sort of like a second quest, if you will, but without the overworld scrambling.<br> <br> In regards to other features this quest offers:<ul class=\"bbc\"><li>Nine main dungeons</li><li>A couple of hidden bonus dungeons</li><li>Around two maps worth of overworld</li><li>Stone collecting side quest</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Retro tracker music OST</li><li>Bad jokes</li><li>Puns</li></ul> Updated 1.1 Changelog:<br> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler\"> <span class=\"spoiler_title\"></span> <input type=\"button\" class=\"bbc_spoiler_show\" value=\"Show\"> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler_wrapper\"><div class=\"bbc_spoiler_content\">Fixed a door in level 8 not working.<br> Fixed a warp in Lunatic Tower not working.<br> Implemented map functionality properly for Lunatic Tower.<br> Fixed a bug where Nayru's Embrace could randomly be used without costing any special.<br> Fixed the frame rate being crap before a certain item was found.<br> Made some rooms in both versions of level 5 slightly easier to see in.<br> Made a secret in Tropara actually have a visual cue, where as previously it did not.<br> Added a minor visual cue to a room in level 8.<br> Possibly other minor changes/bug fixes.</div></div> </div>",

    "descriptionHtml": "This is an overhaul of a quest I made for Gouanaco's 24-hour Quest Contest. Naturally, that version had a number of rough edges and rushed areas, yet it turned out better than I expected, so I gave myself another 12 hours to revise it to (my own) acceptable standards. The new version has nearly twice as many items and secrets, large price reductions on previous items, more manageable high-level enemies, many visual design enhancements, multiple continue points across the overworld, a customized subscreen, and most of all, an expanded final dungeon that fits the progression of the first 3.<br> <br> Conditionally, the quest was <em class=\"bbc\">designed</em> in 36 hours. Per the contest rules, resources such as tile sheets, music, sounds, and scripts were allowed to be gathered <em class=\"bbc\">before </em>the designing phase began. Then, once compiled, the countdown began. Minor malfunctions and other glitches were allowed to be fixed <em class=\"bbc\">after </em>construction, so long as we worked with what we had at the time limit. The 36-hour update followed the same guidelines, in which I finished all additional design in 12 hours, then corrected functionality issues and brief tile errors afterward.<br> <br> The end result is a short and simple quest that features a slightly expanded classic-based tileset, a clear-cut 4-segmented overworld with 4 straight-forward dungeons, a story in which you go through things to collect things to open things to defeat things, a variety of characters that may or may not know more than one identical sentence, and traditional tried-and-true gameplay, all culminating in a climactic face off with Standard Ganon. Due to the quest's rushed production, you'll also find a few items / enemies / design themes / gimmicks rehashed from my first quest. Further, the quest features exceptionally Ben-tastic dialogue, as the contest was anonymous and it was suggested we spoof other designers' styles and gimmicks to confuse players.<br> <br> ...what, you wanted profound originality, groundbreaking graphics, sprawling dungeons, epic purpose-driven story, intricate character development, and fully scripted interfaces, all while forcing a 36-hour limit on me? Ha!

This version differs from the original version I submitted for the 24 Hour Contest mostly in that the final dungeon is not as unfair. And I added a hall of fame.

Right now, since the quest has not been released, the hall of fame has place holder names. But PM me with your times to get included in the hall of fame in future updates of the quest. Runs with video or pictures will be prioritized over runs without any context or evidence. Also right now the only category being included is real time, meaning the in game time is irrelevant (use a timer online, anything like that to keep track). Also message me if you want to see some other category added. For some more finer print detail read the tips and cheats.<br> <br> Also check the help thread on FASTER for the most up to date records (as I won't be constantly updating the quest).<br> <br> That's it.

    "descriptionHtml": "Welcome to TLoZ: Beginnings, a short Z1 style quest aimed at giving people a very nostalgic feel. I tried to challenge myself and make it so that the quest is as non-linear as possible. Because of that, almost the whole world is open to you as soon as you start and it is possible to get into most dungeons early. Sequence breaking is encouraged if you wish to challenge yourself and see what you can get in later dungeons. You may not be able to complete later dungeons fully early on, but you can get some stuff before tackling earlier dungeons. It's all up to you if you wish to do things in order or not.<br> <br> Other random features include:<br> - Slightly updated gameplay. Slash and diagonal movement are enabled, and a slightly wider variety of items from the standard Z1 set.<br> - Z2 enemy tier system. Generally goes from Orange -&gt; Red -&gt; Blue, but some enemies disobey this system.<br> - Secrets everywhere! Sometimes they're in obvious locations, other times they're not.<br> - Heart Pieces instead of Heart Containers, just to make exploration a bit more worth it.<br> - No door repairs anywhere. Bet you'll love that :P<br> <br> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler\"> <span class=\"spoiler_title\">UPDATE LOG</span> <input type=\"button\" class=\"bbc_spoiler_show\" value=\"Show\"> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler_wrapper\"><div class=\"bbc_spoiler_content\"><strong class=\"bbc\">29/09/2019 1st Quest Update:</strong><br> - Tweaked most dungeons by adding in shortcuts and more ways to travel through dungeons. If you can find the new paths, you could even skip some keys and jump ahead a bit! Some dungeons have remained untouched.<br> - Made some enemies more consistent with the colour tiers (e.g. you won't find blue octoroks in the overworld anymore, they're dark red now)<br> - Gohma rooms now have at least one door open in the event of running out of rupees for the arrows. The exception is the red Gohma in Level 2 as the Hookshot can hurt it.<br> - Converted all songs to .ogg format.<br> - Spacebar map is now enabled for all dungeons. This should allow making dungeons a bit more manageable in case you find yourself going in loops.<br> - Quest is now fully compatible with 2.53!<br> - Plans for a second quest are now on the way!</div></div> </div>",

The only exception to this is one room in Level 9, but if you remember what Z1 did, then you should be fine.<br>- Exploration is key!",

    "descriptionHtml": "Hello. This is a quest I made in 2002-2003. This version, specifically, is an update to the 2003 version that was never publicly released that had two dungeons left unfinished and lots of the overworld removed. I decided restore the missing overworld sections and make the two dungeons that were originally supposed to be in, fix a lottttt of bugs, and release it for whatever reason. I'm basically only submitting it here because I want all my finished quests to be easily available and not lost on some old webpage nobody can find.<br> <br> It's not super good and it's pretty badly dated, even for a 1.92-era quest. I'd say the difficulty is somewhere between easy and moderate, with weird random spikes here and there and an overall decline in difficulty as the quest goes on, depending on how much extra equipment you find.<br> <br> There's a lot more in the readme.<br> <br> A few other things:<br> - As stated before, this quest bears no relation to the \"Legend of Zelda Ganon's Revenge\" by cousinoer5. As far as I know, both this quest and its predecessor \"Ganon's Revenge\" predate his, and the same names are a coincidence.<br> - A few of you might remember this quest better as Agahnim's Revenge DX -- I attempted a reboot in like 2005. It was pretty lazy and mostly went nowhere and I never did anything past Level 2.<br> - I decided when I was updating the quest to also upgrade it to 2.10. Mostly I did this because it was slightly more convenient for me to develop in, but I also went ahead and added Farore's Wind and Nayru's Love to the quest. I also decided to take advantage of Link Tile Mod and made it so that Link's hands change color when he gets gloves, similar to ALTTP.<br> <br> <em class=\"bbc\">Last updated: 11/17/2017.

Purchasing a major item from a shop will make it disappear from any extra copies of it. You can also find caves that let you get some shop items for free, if you have not bought them yet. Save rupees by looking for the freebies first.<br><br>There are also a pair of Chest Mini-games. Unlike the money making games, you pay to open each chest and keep what's inside. These chests will contain major items, so save up to open all of them. You don't need the rupees to open all of them at once though.<br><br>Key items are grouped by Tier. Later Tiers require some key items from the previous Tier and potentially ALL key items from even earlier ones. It is worth exploring earlier Tiers for key items before later ones.<br><br>You always start in a house. There are 16 houses on the Island. Many of these contain shops that can contain early key items.<br><br>Two of the Tier I Shrines will appear in dungeon structures on the Island. This can help find the early Shrines easier.<br><br>Later Shrines are more hidden. You won't find them by checking open caves.<br><br>Although keys can work on any lock like in Zelda 1, the number of keys/locks per Shrine is a 1 to 1 ratio. Sometimes buying an extra key will save time, even if you are going for 100% item locations.<br><br>One option for length is called Grand Tour. This makes ALL Shrines AND Elder Shrines to appear. This tends to create a very long run; it might be worth playing a few shorter runs first to get a feel for how things work.<br><br>If you get stuck, the hints from the Islanders can help.<br><br>Using the Ex3 Map to mark locations to return to is VERY helpful. Pick a color you like for this and stick with it.<br><br>There are actually multiple endings. I suspect one of them will be very nice for a low% run.<br><br>Some items will vary from run to run. Some can be used in place of key items from sequence breaks.<br><br>Doing another run? The Ex Buttons set the options to a bunch of defaults. These defaults reflect a couple of scenarios: Lots of Items, Minimal Items, Closer to Z1, and All Item Locations Filled. If you want to be surprised, the MAP button randomly sets the options... but you don't know what it sets them to.<br><br>You can choose the number of \"Extra Weapons\" that appear in a run. These are the last few rows of items in the inventory, and all are optional. There are a lot of different weapons you can find, and you can also control what styles of weapons appear. If you have more than 5 extra weapons, the first row of 5 is the one affected by the style option.<br><br>Plays fine in 2.53, also fairly stable in 2.55",

Hopefully.<br>UPDATE2: Pretty big update! Fixed a bunch of bugs, added text boxes, and just generally made touch-ups here and there to hopefully enhance the experience.",

They found him rafting back to Hyrule with Zelda, so they sent them off-course, snatching Zelda up along the way. The Wizzrobes knew that Zelda's Triforce could revive anything from the dead, and they planned to use it on Ganon. Zelda, knowing this, split the Triforce up, but before she could warn Link against collecting them, she was taken to Ganon's Lair. Link saw the shards fly off to a nearby island by the name of Mirago Island, so he set off there to begin his search.",

There are no defence upgrades, everything is balanced around having no rings.<br>- In either age there is a warp zone where you can open up paths to allow for fast travel. Be sure to open up these paths along the way by entering red portals across the overworld.<br>- The trading quest can only be accessed after the main story is completed, though you can find hints as to what NPCs want throughout the quest. Be sure to take notes of what NPCs want and where they are to make the sequence easier when you get to it. Alternatively, you can just look at the text file, but that ruins the fun :P<br>- There is a specific item given as one of the post-game dungeon prizes which can break the current save file completely when used, as this is intended to be a joke item.

This update doesn't have enough new features (or a new labyrinth) to justify a new version number and subtitle, but it introduces a lot of new goodies, mostly as follow ups from the official race. See below for more details. <strong class=\"bbc\">This update will break saves and requires three new songs, which can be downloaded <a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/file/bau3bfw16e8vxz3/4.5_Update_Music.zip/file\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">here.</a></strong><br> <br> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler\"> <span class=\"spoiler_title\">Changelog</span> <input type=\"button\" class=\"bbc_spoiler_show\" value=\"Show\"> <div class=\"bbc_spoiler_wrapper\"><div class=\"bbc_spoiler_content\">- As Dimi won the race, his character, Victor, has been added to the game and can be selected from the character select screen. Victor's gimmick largely revolves around sacrificing HP for various boosts. His Muramasa does good damage, but if he misses with it, he'll lose HP but regain MP. Casting Thunder will give him an offensive boost but drain 3 orbs of HP over time. He also gains speed the more empty life orbs he has. But be careful: he loses defense the more enemies are on screen! He's also got a unique coin upgrade, Longer Buffs, which increases the duration of Enhance, L2 Enhance, Power Boost, and Poison.<br> - Bone Zone and Mothership, two new areas which debuted in the race, now appear in the Fragmented Labyrinth.<br> - Lumen, who debuted as a boss in the race, appears now as a challenge area boss, rather than a Venter Mortis boss as she was in the race.<br> - Custom seeds are now supported! <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/358361431348871170/688185427198607463/SeedTemplate.z\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">This file</a> has templates and instructions on how to fill them out. No scripted knowledge is required; just fill in the blanks with the appropriate constants and you'll have a working custom seed function. Send it my way and I can have the quest updated with your seed in a matter of minutes.<br> - Official Race Seed 1 is selectable from the custom seeds list (and is currently the only custom seed). As Lumen as now a challenge area boss, she's been replaced as the race's final boss by someone else.<br> - Lumen and Bastille's story mode has a new cutscene.<br> - Dracus and Autimecia now have subscreen dialogue.<br> - LOTS of bugs have been fixed. Way too many to list, but to name some of the bigger ones people have complained about:<br> --- Sixth Area B and Lake of Lighting are now properly accounted for by Fragmented logic.<br> --- The snake platforms in Lac D'Amour B no longer bug out.<br> --- Traps in a room will no longer cause enemies to respawn.<br> --- Warp points you haven't visited will no longer randomly activate.</div></div> </div><br> <br> <br> 9/15/2019<br> Introducing Yuurand 4.0: The Fragmented Labyrinth.

    "descriptionHtml": "This quest was designed for seasoned players of the 1st and 2nd quests at least. Most of the rules from those quests apply here. The Letter, Blue Ring, two sword upgrades and five heart containers can be found in the overworld, while the rest of the special items and two bomb upgrades are in the dungeons. Secrets are not terribly obscure. Pushblocks are always multidirectional. There are only two door repair charges, but clues forewarn their location.<br><br>For all that it has in common with Hyrule, Southrule is a little different. People speak faster. Hearts refill faster. Like Likes and Wall Masters move a bit quicker. And clocks do not suspend time indefinitely.",

    "descriptionHtml": "This quest was created based around the idea any dungeon may be done in any order, while keeping a story on the side. While this quest only features four main dungeons (and one final dungeon), each dungeon you complete will unlock various things to do (including collectibles and mini-dungeons). The dungeons in this quest aren't linear at all, so you may become a bit confused when playing them. The quest as a whole should take 4-6 hours to complete, so clearly, the quest isn't that long.<br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\">UPDATE LOG:</strong><br> <br> Update 06/11/18<br> - Made it so the switches in Cragboure Castle are easily distinguishable between being pressed and not being pressed.<br> - Included Item Pick-up strings for the Boss Keys.<br> - Re-coloured cave entrance tiles.<br> - Fixed the hitboxes of the Stones.<br> - Changed song file type to .ogg.<br> <br> Update 07/11/18<br> - Made it so you can enter and leave the boss key room in The Kiln without defeating the enemies.<br> - Made it so you can't trap yourself in the mirror/block puzzle room in The Dry Desire.<br> - Added a sound effect for each time you press a switch.<br> <br> Update 08/11/18<br> - Fixed the issue in The Kiln where two tiles would be replaced by inactive spikes.<br> - Replaced pots in the final corridor and other locations of The Windborne Bastion.<br> - Fixed the duplication issue where the ending text repeated itself at the end of each dungeon.<br> - When collecting a Stone, there is now music which plays to shorten the awkward pause.<br> - More NPCs in the quest now tell you about the story and the world.<br> - There are now more continue points available to the player (notably when you exit/enter important dungeons of the quest).<br> - Some Zelda songs in the quest have been replaced with new ones.<br> <br> Update 09/11/18<br> - Renamed all music files in order to avoid ZC confusing SC song files with other song files. (If you had already downloaded the music file, you'd need to do it again)<br> - The Goron Sword is now open to you from the start, however, in order to collect it, you need five hearts.<br> - The download link for the songs no longer uses Mediafire, it now uses Dropbox.<br> <br> Update 13/11/18<br> - The staircase southeast of Tingle in The Kiln is now only accessible if you kill the hammer enemy and the others.<br> <br> Update 13/03/19<br> - Removed the bypass on one of the puzzles in The Dry Desire, where you were able to skip the entire hookshot puzzle.<br> <br> Update 16/03/19<br> - The final bosses have been slightly buffed (health increase, and their fireballs can no longer be blocked with a shield).<br> <br> Update 27/11/19<br> - Updated consistency issues with the Shovel and quicksand.<br> - Removed some Bombchus from Goron Settlement to prevent unavoidable damage.<br> - Made it easier to find the Bucket, which starts the Trade Sequence - Minor adjustments made to the drop rate.<br> - Changed the trap room in The Tumulus.<br> - Added a shortcut skipping the trap room in the Tumulus.<br> - Added secret sound effects for switches in Cragboure Castle.",

The challenges for the Stones were designed to keep Mortals out, so now the brother must be careful when collecting the Stones.<br><br>It is up to you to choose what to do first, and only you can ensure he accomplishes his destiny.",

    "descriptionHtml": "Randomizer Omega is the finale in a long line of Randomizer quests. It sticks to the Zelda 1 style, but now with nearly everything from previous quests combined with new features.<br><br>For those unfamiliar, a Randomizer takes a base world, and shuffles things like items around, so you don't know what you'll find where. Randomizers often come with an option to enter a seed, which will produce the same results if entered the same. This randomizes both where each cave goes on an overworld, and item locations. In addition, there are options to vary the length. There are multiple overworlds you can start in, and searching around will find warps between them.<br><br>Although the overworlds and dungeons may be Zelda 1 styled, there area lot of quality of life features that make it feel much more advanced. Compasses give a tone if killing all enemies drops an important item. You can track where each cave goes on the overworld, and also see progress on collecting all items in the current area. A Fortune Teller can reveal important locations like dungeons on the map, but you'll need to keep paying to reveal more. Secrets are far more obvious than those in Zelda 1. Dungeon doors are custom, removing issues like suction from bombed walls, and fake walls expect Lens of Truth to find them.<br><br>There are up to 4 Owerworlds and 16 sets of 9 dungeons. Options can control how many overworlds you can travel between, the number of dungeon sets located in each, and how the dungeons are placed and distributed between the worlds. There are even a few options to generate a world similar to past randomizers.<br><br>There are hundreds of items you can obtain. The actual total number of items varies from length or options regarding Heart Pieces, but you can have a total over 500.<br><br>Each overworld has its own set of Triforce Pieces linked to it, and all Level 9s in that world need all 8 of those pieces to enter. You will only find those pieces in the world they belong in, traveling to different worlds will reveal different pieces.<br><br>The final goal is to defeat Ganon and rescue Zelda. His true location is unknown, but looking around and clearing those Level 9s may give the clues needed to find him.",
    "storyHtml": "Ganon has taken Zelda to his Tower, you need to rescue her. However, you don't know what to expect along the way. Not even the world you come from stays the same. Perhaps by overcoming countless monsters, rupee stealing Old Men, hungry Goriyas, lazy toll-keeping minions, and Ganon's best minions, will you reach your goal.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "A lot of the clues given by NPCs can be useful. On a first play, you may want to keep those hints normal, and read them all.<br><br>The Ex 3 and 4 buttons bring up some special menus. The map shows where all the caves in the current overworld go, and you can use A and B to change the color of them, for a personalized tracking system. The weapon menu lets you pick which 18 items can be cycled between in the normal inventory, and some special weapons come in multiple variations that you can switch between in this menu. You can also do a sort to pick the 18 highest leveled weapons owned, and even choose to sort based on their type.<br><br>If you choose to play with multiple overworlds, pay attention to which one you start in. Not only will you restart here if you save in quit in any overworld, but a lot of useful early items, plus something else important, will appear in this world. You will need to explore other worlds, and sooner depending on the difficulty chosen.<br><br>Enemies get more difficult as the level number increases. It is worth sticking to the early levels for a while until you have a lot of useful exploration items, a decent weapon, and some more life before doing the late ones.<br><br>Once you know where the true Final Dungeon is, note you can get there really early, without completing a single level 9.<br><br>In the starting cave, you can toggle if items have a description when picked up. You can also use the training dummy to test the strength of the weapons you've got.<br><br>All Pols Voice have a secret weakness. It is never the Sword or Sword Beams, those just do normal damage.<br><br>Every overworld has a cave where you can get one of those major shop items for free. You may want to find this before buying out every shop.<br><br>In very long lengths, you may encounter P Bags. These just give you rupees and ammo, as there are more locations for items to appear than the total items.<br><br>I totally wouldn't drop multiple hints about bonus content. Not at all.",

The last part of the game, however, including all of Ganon's Fortress, is heavily loaded with story, cutscenes, characters and weirdness.<br> <br> Cutscenes feature animated portraits, all drawn by me. Some are larger and more detailed than others, or they change as the game goes on for story reasons. Oh, except Din. Din isn't animated. Din is a statue.<br> <br> This quest is very hard.

    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "1. If you skip or ignore dialogue, you will likely end up not knowing what to do or unable to beat a boss. Characters say important gameplay-related things.<br> <br> 2. All secrets that are better than rupees are indicated in some way. A bush standing on its own; the only flat rock surface on the screen; other unique terrain features; dialogue hints. If you go burning every non-descript bush and bombing every wall, you will find rupees, but that is probably all.<br> <br> 3. If something is way too hard, you might be there too early, or there might be items you haven't found yet outside of whatever dungeon you're delving.<br> <br> 4. Some dungeons have multiple entrances.<br> <br> 5. All keese and bats drop huge amounts of magic. Bats = magic. Magic = bats. Bagic = mats.<br> <br> 6. There are some very weird and very out of the way secrets placed in unorthodox ways. The more completely bizarre a secret is, the less likely it has something really important to find. So if you miss them, you're probably only missing a weird joke or funny scene. If you actually find the faerie, for example, no, she doesn't drop anything. It's not a bug. It's just a silly event.<br> <br> <span rel=\"lightbox\">Posted Image</span><br> <br> 7. Translating the Dutch won't reveal any important gameplay secrets. If you're not actually Dutch, even translating it won't help that much in understanding. It's very slang-ridden, and everything Dutch Guy says is... very weird.<br> <br> 8. There are two endings. If you beat the game and you are super depressed and ready to cry, you got the bad ending. But the good ending is still possible to reach if you reload! Just... think about a better way to do what you just did?<br> <br> 9. Download the music. Jokes will fall completely flat without it.",

    "storyHtml": "At the outset of Hyrule, there were three Goddesses. Din, Farore, and Nayru. The Triforce was the culmination of their essences.The Triforce itself was alive, and could see its very grim future. In order to preserve itself, it created an avatar, a Knight of incredible power. The Triforce Knight was given Free Will, but a strong sense of responsibility. Link has journeyed far away, Zelda is sealed, and Ganon runs amok. Hyrule hangs in the balance for his quest to restore the Triforce to unity.",

After receiving a call for help intended for his late mother, the young Zora prince Kell travels to the Northern Sea to help. With the Zora's Sapphire to protect him, he descends below the waves, seeking answers and a means to dispel the curse. But things are not as they seem, and he quickly finds himself entangled in an ancient conflict far different from what he was expecting.",

    "creditsHtml": "A full list of credits can be viewed upon clearing the quest.<br><br>However, I wish to recognize a few people who greatly contributed here. Moosh's help cannot be understated. He provided the Hookshot 2 tileset upon which this quest was built and created all the dungeon palettes and several overworld palettes for me, based off my sometimes difficult descriptions. He also made sprites for the main characters and offered several ideas which ended up becoming incorporated into the quest. In a similar vein, Aevin contributed several ideas to the quest, as well as the subscreen and underwater overlay effects. At several points along the way, he also served as a well of emotional support to help pull me through this process. Finally, I'd like to thank Zoria for running the contest which spawned this quest in the first place, as well as all the other contest entrants, whose work helped inspire and motivate me these last few months.",

Your character will grow as you kill enemies and how they grows will vary slightly depending on what tools you use to fight. Mana regain goes up if you use magic weapons, you learn more technical combat moves if you use physical weapons, etc. You're expected to play carefully and manage combat encounters in thoughtful manners, especially in the early to mid game, late game can be a bit different depending on your character growth.<br><br>The quest is decently sized with the dungeon being around 12 floors of varying sizes, some backtracking is encouraged at times, there are also a few optional areas that might be worth your time. It's hard to measure exact playtime for the quest, but I'd expect *at least* 4-5 hours on a first casual playthrough, and that's factoring in a few deaths.<br><br>The quest originally started as a contest entry for a 2 week contest years ago, but it was later finished back in 2017, and now, it's finally avalible on PureZC for you to enjoy!",

    "descriptionHtml": "I was a little kid when Zelda came out in the 80s. When I wasn't playing NES, I would walk around our woodsy neighborhood holding a stick, pretending I was Link fighting my way through Hyrule. I would imagine there were enemies, traps, and secret entrances to dungeons. Now, several years later I got this amazing opportunity to build a Zelda quest based on all of that.<br><br>The quest differs from most quests since it based tightly on a real life place. It works without having the typical areas such as a snow area or mountains or desserts. Despite there being a lot of forest the map still remains diverse.<br><br>You'll find nine dungeon that progress in difficulty and complexity as you play through. I was certain utilize the enemy editor to the fullest extent creating unique version of the normal Zelda foes. It uses the Classic XD tileset with a ton of custom tiles for whatever else I wanted to put into the game.",

I suggest you use them.<br><br>There is little wasted space in the dungeons. Every room either leads to important room or is important itself. If you feel like you're lost, check out your map and make sure you didn't miss anything. Sometimes you will have to backtrack and take look closer.<br><br>As you will find out, there are eight keys hidden throughout the overworld guarded by. You need these to complete the final dungeon.

Yeah, I know, we've all seen 1st quest remakes haven't we? But have we seen any quest attempt to use smaller, GB-sized screens?",
    "descriptionHtml": "Hyrule's Awakening is a very experimental, proof-of-concept quest. In it's simplest, it's just a remake of Z1 in the GB style, but it's much more than that. It uses many scripts to make it feel as close to GB Zeldas as possible. Now, this could all have been even better, but keep in mind this was the best I could do with existing scripts I could find, since I can't script anything myself.<br><br>The main focus when creating this was to not make the best possible quest out there, but to just show you that GB-sized screens are somewhat possible in ZC, and also show my vision of a Zelda 1 remake in Link's Awakening style. Also, one could see this as my love letter to the Game Boy/GB Color, Link's Awakening and Zelda 1!<br><br>~FEATURES~<br>- The dungeon layouts, overworld areas and base screens are all based on the original Zelda 1st Quest, but everything has been remade in Link's Awakening style, trying to match that style as closely as possible.<br>- The dungeons are completely different from Z1's aside from their layout. The dungeons are much closer to Link's Awakening's dungeons actually.<br>- GB-SIZED SCREENS! This is all thanks to Avaro's Scrollwarping Doors script in the database. The screens are now the same size as they would be in Link's Awakening/Oracles. The subscreen, sadly I couldn't move so it would be connected to the screens sadly, since I can't script anything myself, and it would have required a completely customly scripted subscreen to work.<br>- Items are more based on Link's Awakening, so you'll see stuff like the Roc's Feather or an equippable Power Bracelet.<br>- Scripted bosses and enemies; many enemies from Link's Awakening have been recreated for this, and all the bosses are custom (aside from one Patra, and some minibosses).<br>- 2 simple trading sequences.<br><br>UPDATE 1:<br>- Removed the possibility of running into a softlock in Level 5<br>- Added one extra key to Level 3 to prevent a hardlock<br>- Adjusted one overworld screen to, once again, fix a potential softlock",
    "storyHtml": "The plot is the same as the original Zelda 1, obviously :P",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "KNOWN ISSUES:<br>- Continuing in the overworld is wonky.<br>- Some screens (mostly when switching DMaps in the overworld) use instant warps instead of scrolling<br>Expect some general wonkiness in general, many things work weird with the scrollwarps and at times I was overwhelmed myself with the amount of scripts I was using.",

Dungeon difficulty is usually indicated by the colours of the statues at the entrance of every dungeon (Silver = Easy, Red = Hard), and these are determined when you enter your first few dungeons.<br>- If you are having trouble with a dungeon and feel underpowered, leave and come back later with better gear or try to go for the dungeon item and then leave. This is once again very dependent on the route you take.<br>- There is a short postgame after you beat the main quest.<br>- If you need any help, be sure to ask in the help thread on the forums. This quest is unpassworded though, so if you really want to you can look through the quest yourself for help, but be warned that you'll most likely get spoiled for stuff.",

Knight, wizard, monk, or thief (Link's decision 1 2007 only had the first two). Each will get a different set of items based on the class's two common abilities: offense, defense, magic, trickery. No matter which you choose, you'll only be able to reach six out of twelve class dungeons, but you can see all in two playthroughs if (in-game information).<br>This v2.10 quest was almost entirely built while 2.50 was in beta.

Ganon has somehow managed to sneak into the King's Bunker, which is only able to opened for Calatia's king and queen. Whether Ganon found a way in or was somehow spawned inside doesn't matter, there's no way the King would want to visit the bunker now. So, Ganon thinks that he has a permanent foothold, and everybody assumes Ganon could never be driven out.<br>A hero who could collect all six ancient relics will have proven themselves worthy to enter in the king's place.

Ganon appears and captures her once again.<br> <br> Zelda called for Link with a cry for help. Link hears her voice and follows it. Then notices the Giant dungeon shrouded in dark clouds.

If one moves, the shutter will open and you can progress. <br> <br> Stage 4, second half, next room after entrance, one block can be pushed (after all enemies beaten) will open the stairs that you get a large quiver.<br> <br> When you fight peahats, wait until one stops, then inflict damage by stabbing.<br> <br> Remember that stages 2-9, the fourth room after the entrance of first half, you have to pay the amount of arrows to the Moblin or lose a heart container to pass to the fifth room. You will die if you have one life heart left.

There older brother and sister, Link and Zelda, went on this fantastic journey on the so called \"Surface\". After many weeks of waiting, Skyloft, and its people, went down and lived on the \"Surface', or now known as Hyrule, because the young kids brother and sister beat the evil down here. So, as the story of these two young kids go on, they grow older and learn more of the Triforce, and the journey there siblings went on. They both now know the truth of how the story of the known game, Skyward Sword, is.<br><br>Many years later when the two kids were now teens, they had full control of the Triforce. As there decision together, they decided to order guards and workers to make 3 temples for the Triforce of, Power, Wisdom, and Courage shall lay. They chose to lay them there because they haven't heard or felt evil lurking in the shadows for a while. One day, in Kokiri Forest, the two kids, named Link &amp; Zelda, were going on a stroll date. After about 2 minutes of walking, Zelda walks into this black dark hole, without paying attention to where it was. Link try's to save her, but it was 2 late, but the hole was still there. Being an idiot Link was, he throws 3/4 of the bombs he had down the hole, nothing happens. Suddenly, Ganon comes out, and has Zelda captured. As I quote Ganon \"Idiot, you think you could beat me with bombs! HA Try again some other time kid.\" Ganon flys off. As he does, Zelda shouts, \"LINK, GET THE MASTER SWORD AND WHISTLE!! USE WHISTLE FOR GETTING THE TRIFOR------!!!\"<br><br>Now this is when Link starts his journey, finding the Master Sword and whistle, to get to Ganon, defeat him, and save Zelda. If you get lucky you may get a HUGE kiss from her. ;)",

Also changed the 10 Rockhandla room in Level 9 into L2 Lanmolas.<br> UPDATE 8: String error after Level 1's Triforce piece.

There is a Magic Mirror, you can leap down from certain ledges, and several Link to the Past enemies such as Ropas, Bari, Popo, and more make an appearance. The dungeon design is also an attempt at duplicating the design philosophy used for Link to the Past's famous dungeons.<br> <br> The quest has also been designed to be played repeatedly.

    "descriptionHtml": "Basically done to show off some spriting and tilework I had done for both overworld and dungeon tiles in classic, Magic and Fantasy doesn't do a lot of things fancy. It aims to impress by keeping the technical details simple and workable. That said, it still maintains a strong epic feeling which promises players an epic adventure across the grand kingdom of Hyrule. With this in mind, I do want to mention that the quest makes use of some nifty little Zquest tricks.<br><br>UPDATE - Oct. 17 2017 - Magic and Fantasy has been drastically updated.<br><br>- new graphics - certain areas of the map have had graphical additions or tweaks. This includes new background tiles on Death Mountain, a smoke effect around Kakariko Village, and a forest canopy effect over portions of the western and eastern overworld. Abei and Ama have also been resprited.<br>- new songs - certain parts of the overworld have been divided off into their own Dmaps and given their own background music.<br>- Level 8 shortcut - a certain shortcut leading to level 8 has been addressed. Level 8 has a lot of buildup for the final dungeon and isn't appropriate to access early, so this has thankfully been dealt with.<br>- other tweaks - some of the message strings have been changed a little bit in cases where something might have been too cryptic, or a plot element flew over someone's head, or something. Basically, I'm listening to you guys. Also, more caves, more rupees, the ability to upgrade your bomb supply to a total of 16, better mileage for the hammer, and more challenging difficulty later on.<br><br>UPDATE - Oct. 22<br><br>- fatal error patched - Level 9 was inaccessible<br>- 16th heart added<br>- apparently Armos in snowy environments routinely stand on actual snow despite having been in that position for god knows how long. BECAUSE IT MAKES A GOOD UNDER COMBO<br>- other things I'll pretend were always there but I really snuck in.",
    "storyHtml": "Late in the night, sounds could be heard from Hyrule Castle. Swords clashing, people screaming... nobody outside knew what was going on, but soon monsters started appearing all over the kingdom. It was soon discovered that Princess Zelda had been taken in the night by monsters... but where? what for? Were they after the Triforce of Wisdom she kept? What would they do without the Triforce of Power, in possession of the sealed Dark Lord?<br><br>One young man from the local village sets foot in the castle, unarmed, looking for answers. His query unravels into a grand quest to reassemble the shattered Triforce of Courage and deliver the princess from evil once again.",

    "descriptionHtml": "<span><em class=\"bbc\"><span><strong class=\"bbc\">Please note:</strong></span> this is being uploaded to PureZC for <strong class=\"bbc\">archival purposes</strong> only.</em></span><br> <br> \"Language. Sex. Violence. Other?\", or LSVO as it became to be known, was originally released in late 2009. Because PureZC would only accept 2.10 quests at the time, it was hosted on an alternative quest database in zcrealm, a site which has since long vanished from the internet. A few months ago, I was looking for this quest as reference material for <a href=\"https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=projects&amp;id=550\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"\">Three Crests</a>, only to realise that I no longer had it. I'd thought I lost the quest for good - I made this quest on my parents' computer at the time, which I assume is long gone in the 13 or so years since then. Through the help of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100201073438/http://www.zcrealm.net/quest.php?num=29\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">the Wayback Machine</a>, I was able to recover a version of it.<br> <br> However, the original version is significantly outdated. Upon release, the quest was buggy, rough and needed a lot of work. There's sequence breaking, along with many potential soft-locks. I'd taken a break from PureZC almost immediately after release (the forum thread at the time cites a broken computer for the reason?), and Exate took on the role of principal debugger and cleaner of all things broken. That version, which I'm labelling as the Exate Edition, is the superior of the two for obvious reasons. It wasn't hosted on zcrealm, but the also now-defunct Exalted Legion instead.<br> <br> More recently, Deathrider365 messaged the PureZC Discord asking about the quest's existence for a commenter on their LPs. Upon a quick search on the forums I realised that not only had Exate posted a mediafire link to his version of the quest, but that the link still worked!<br> <br> So for archival purposes, I present Language. Sex. Violence. Other?, the Exate Edition. It's a sprawling mess of a quest, but a glorious one at that.",
    "storyHtml": "From the 2009 release on zcrealm:<br><br>This was started sometime between August and September 2008, after the somewhat failure of \"Legend of Koop\", which only had up to Level 5 completed. Time passed, and now here is, almost a year and a half later. 10 dungeons, two full overworlds, and unlike my last major quest, Protector of the Damn Universe, hardly any dialogue. There's no real plot until after Level 3; I couldn't be bothered setting up some fancy story about the Ruler of Hyrule, and how he gave his noble servant a bucket of buffalo wings.<br>Note: There is low amounts of coarse language in the quest. You have been advised.<br>So, yeah. Have a play with it. If you enjoy it, let me know.",
    "tipsAndCheatsHtml": "A warning: this quest gets absurdly hard. Eppy37 has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zew-cqsmCVg&amp;list=PL27CEDBA8DCB9C6D3\" class=\"bbc_url\" title=\"External link\" rel=\"nofollow external\">Let's Play</a> from around the time of the quest's release, which makes for essential viewing regarding the difficulty curve - I have also linked the Let's Play above. The later stages of the quest appear to really ramp up in difficulty - the Blue Ring is found in Level 8, and upon looking at it for the first time in over a decade, Level 7 looks like an absolute nightmare without it.<br> <br> Once more, <strong class=\"bbc\">I've uploaded this quest for archival purposes only.</strong><br> <br> <strong class=\"bbc\"> </strong>I can't stress this enough - I will NOT be able to edit anything in the quest. Bugs, glitches, game balance or cheats are all untouchable. It's been thirteen years and I have no idea what the quest password might be. I may not be totally able to provide concrete answers for questions like \"where is the sword\" or \"where is the next dungeon\" either - it's a giant, sprawling quest with little guidance for the player on what or where they should head next. Again, Eppy's LP may be a worthwhile reference if you're stuck on a particular section of the quest.<br> <br> I assume this quest is playable in 2.53 and beyond - in 2.55 a101, I got as far as the fifth dungeon in the original quest file that I recovered from the archived zcrealm release.",
