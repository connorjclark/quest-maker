After finding a wooden sword in a cave, he goes to see Zelda, where he learns that the strange events that are taking place have been happening because Ganon captured the Queen Fairy.

    "description": "Dragon Legend of Zelda: Unification is a quest full of puzzles and secrets that will take some thinking to get through. Features that are usually not in BS Quests have shown up in here including a hookshot, Lens of Truth, Golden Arrows, and more! Also, a warning to beginners. It's recommended you play a few other quests to learn the feel of ZC before playing this quest, as it does assume you have experience.\n\nUPDATES:\n\nThe updated version is just named unification.qst in the zip file. But I'm also bundling the original non-modified release in here as unification-original.qst. Only play that version if you don't want any of the updates listed below. Both versions were still created in 1.90.\n \nUPDATE 1.0.2 (7/29/2014):\n\n1. Hopefully fixed a dead end in level 8 that forced you to do a continue warp.\n2. Fixed a block \"puzzle\" in level 2 that would trap you in a block and force you to do a continue warp if you came into the room at the wrong direction.\n3. Hopefully fixed all instances where I used cancel warps so that later ZC versions don't randomly have wavy warps that go nowhere. If you still find some of these, please let me know.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.1 (7/24/2014):\n\nThis is an extremely minor update that does 3 things.\n\n1. Fixed the final boss. Yes, there was supposed to be a final boss. Boss flags and level numbers made him not appear. \n2. Significantly dulled the palettes of level 7, 8, and 9 (green and red). I have no idea how pre-teen me could handle staring at those palettes since they make me dizzy looking at them for a few minutes. The dull colors are by no means great, but I can at least look at them. I have not updated the screenshots to reflect this change.\n3. Added an open door to the room that had a bunch of Pols Voice in level 3. I had never intended for the player to be forced to fight those with the wooden sword or even the level 2 sword and somehow legitimately thought you got the arrows before reaching them. This goes to show how awesome I was at not beta testing anything I made during this time period.\n\nYou're maybe wondering why I'm not bothering to update more despite fixing these issues. Truth be told, I want to keep this up as it is mostly as a record of what I did with my first (and still currently only at the time of writing this) released quest. Doing any major changes to it would ruin that. Of course I'm fully aware that modern ZC players that stumble on this update might play the quest and go \"what is this crap!?\" because of many of my more questionable design decisions (and believe me, there are plenty of them), but that's totally fair since standards change and this was honestly kind of average at most even for the time in my opinion. My own standards have changed since making this and I feel that I've grown as a quest maker since then.\n\nStill, there were people that had fun playing it and I admit I have fun going back and playing it every so often even if I cringe at some of the things I did. So that's why I decided to go through with submitting this update to fix these issues that have irked me for years.\n\nAlso, if there are any other bugs, feel free to mention them and I'll try to fix them if I can. Keep in mind that I'm using 1.90 and DOSBox is a huge pain to operate, so I may not get to everything.",
    "story": "Link is resting in his home one day when Abei appears from nowhere. He tells Link that Ganon found out where the secret island of the Dragon Triforce is and that he kidnapped Zelda as well. Abei then tells Link that big long legend you just read! Link want's to follow Zelda. Abei opens a book and chants a funny incantation. A stairway appears on the floor! Link walks in, and finds himself in a pitch black room! The mist in the room causes Link to pass out! He wakes up to find himself on an island shoreline. Wrote in the sand near the water is:\"Welcome to Dragon Island, the island out of normal human reach!\"The tide comes in and covers the message. Link sudden finds an octorock rushing towards him, ready for the kill (screen to the left of start). Link reaches for his sword, but it is not there. Neither is any of his other gear. The mist had took it from him and scattered it around the island! Also, Ganon had stolen the Master Sword and hid it in his hideout! Ganon also has several fake triforces that Link will have to collect to escape certain rooms! You will determain what Link will do!

    "description": "I started this quest before I first joined AGN back in October of 2000.... It was the first quest I worked on, and the last I'll work on... When it started it was BS-Style all the way... Then I started editing tiles, and added every feature I could possibly think of... then I stopped working on it for a long time...like six months...\n\nWhen I got a craving to work on it again, I came back to it, and 1.90 had just come out, I had to completely upgrade the quest to make room for the new items like the boots and the hookshot... I wanted to have all the possible features.... I came close to finishing the quest, but put it away for a while....\n\nAbout eight or so months later, Dark Nation has put out 1.92 build 163 (or whatever it was) and I get a craving to work on it again... I made so many edits and changes to this damned quest that I think it can't be anything but good at this point, so I'm determined to finish it... I still had much to do, four more underworlds, and quite a bit of fixing up.... \n\nAnd I lost all motivation... I didn't want to see the quest die. Damn i'd worked on it so long I wanted like hell to finish it.... but I knew I never would....\n\nAt the time JayeM was beta testing for me, and we would get to talking about the quest a lot.... and I knew she was very interested in the quest, but I felt so bad for not being able to finish it... So I figured Since I like her quest building style, and I certainly trust her judgment implicitly... I decided to give the quest to JayeM, because I know how much life she'd be able to breathe into it...\n\nThat was a few months ago... two I think... and she's done extraordinarily well with it... adding almost all of the new features from the new beta, developing the remaining dungeons that needed to be finished, as well as expand on the overworld a bit and add new sub levels... \n\nNow the time has come for her to need a beta tester, and I'm doing it myself. Bigjoe has also been beta testing, and has done a terrific job. He also helped out by adding new BS Enemies created by VEL. Special thanks to him.\n\nAnyways, I am truly amazed at how solid a quest this really is. I'm proud to have worked on it for so long, and I'm proud to have JayeM as it's other parent. I hope you'll all enjoy this quest as much as I do.",

I have yet to topple this contribution of mine to the Zelda Classic library. It houses 9 complete dungeons with a optional 'master' dungeon which is quite deviously hidden and poses a interesting challenge once inside. This uses the BS tileset to its fullest potential and I dare say it rivals Revenge 1 in terms of scope and quality as well as challenge. Level 8 and 9 have to be seen to be believed, the epitome of great BS tile dungeon design. A great quest in all aspects, highly recommended.\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Fixed misc. bugs, made sure all continue bugs squashed, and made various detail touch-ups across the board.\n3/25/07 - Fixed a fatal bug where you could do level 7 out of order and get yourself permenently stuck!",

    "description": "The ultimate and final version of Hidden Duality. It included 5 new mini-dungeons, a new arrangement of enemies in certain locations to increase difficulty. Addition of boss keys and various graphical enhancements like shadows and bush clippings. Added many new things and re-arranged things to how I really wanted it to be when I looked back on the original quest in retrospect and wasn't happy with some of it. This is the definitive version of Hidden Duality, it has it all and then some.\n\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Fixed all Dodongo disappearing bugs, tried to squash the level 4 continue bug as best I could, altered various enemy placements throughout the quest. Made minor detail touch-ups across the board and finally eliminated that infinite rupee supplying bush combo in the snow area.",

    "story": "After Link saved Hyrule from the evil grasp of Ganon the kingdom of Hyrule prospered as a major center of trade.  Three other kingdoms called Tenn, Montar, and Frellan arose around Hyrule, as a result of its expansion.  Link put his weapons in the royal armory, because he had no need for them any longer, and the Triforce was placed in the throne room and heavily guarded.  Link moved to the kingdom of Tenn and began to raise a family.  But one fateful day Link was killed by a group of angry moblins; not even his great skill could save him.  For over 10 years Hyrule reigned as the largest kingdom in the world, but the remaining band of Ganon's army sought tirelessly to revive their once great leader.  After 11 long years they finally suceeded.  Ganon easily retook the Triforce in the absense of Link and brought Hyrule to its knees.  9 years later Ganon grew angry because even though he destroyed Hyrule, the three daughter kingdoms still prospered, so he sought to capture and destroy them as well.  He began by kidnapping the princess Julie of Frellan.  Then Ganon created strong-holds (in each Ganon put Link's weapons to keep them from any adventurous soul) in each of the kingdoms and sent his armies out to destroy the land.  Now it is up to Link's son, also named Link, to gather his father's weapons and destroy Ganon in the Dead Land.",

Old save files should work with this new quest file. If you downloaded a copy of the quest before July 6th, 2014, get the updated version linked here.This quest features a full overworld and about a dozen underworlds. It is relatively difficult, so I recommend playing it with a gamepad/controller rather than with the keyboard. PLAY THIS QUEST USING ZELDA CLASSIC 1.90 ONLY! Zelda Classic 1.90 is a DOS program, so your computer needs to be able to run DOS games to run 1.90.[If you cannot run Zelda Classic 1.90, 1.92 b184 should work sufficiently to accomplish all of the main objectives of the quest. If you can't run any 1.9X versions, don't bother trying 2.1X versions. 2.5X versions might lead to troubles that require quitting and loading game save files.]This game is free. I don't profit from it and, by downloading, you agree not to, either. Some of the tiles were taken from other games, but almost all have been uniquely modified. Any perceived trademark is parodied or unintentional. If you have a problem with the game, don't download it and/or delete it from your computer. Any possible adverse effects to your computer (and the systems networked with it) that may be the result of downloading and executing the file are your risks that are to be remedied at nobody's expense beyond your own.",

You notice, however, that enemies stand in your way and the twins seem to have locked themselves in their bedroom. After defeating those that interfere, one of the ladies explains that a wolf has stolen away her sister and, more importantly, her Gameboy. Vowing to return with it (and her), you set off, mowing down the evildoers. With the ground thoroughly searched, you realize you will have to use the lessons of your dreams in real life and use your waking experience in lucid dreams, if you are to secure the units necessary to find the Gameboy and \"What's-Her-Name?\"...And so much more, like some deal about an \"Octoforce\" or something.

    "description": "It borrows from the Wind Waker concept of a world with a big ocean; with islands dotting the landscape. Well since ZC is on a screen by screen basis, screens of just simply water would be boring as hell to travel through. So except in certain cases, there will be land in almost every screen on the massive 16x16 overworld. So its like Wind Waker, but the island are more jam-packed together. This prevents long sailing times on the raft and later, long swim times with the flippers. So I hope this speeds things up a bit.\nAnyway, there will be some story in the form of Aryll, your sister and townspeople in your home town, Goron City and Zora Cave. After levels 1, 7 and 8, you can return to these towns and get new information out of them and get a new item from Aryll.\nNow the game starts off on your home island and you MUST complete level 1 and then visit Aryll to get the raft so you can get off your island and explore the ocean. Now from here on in, you have FREE exploration through almost ALL the islands and areas of the huge overworld. You can tackle levels 2-7 in ANY order you choose. With the small exception of gaining flippers from level 5 to access level 6. Other than that, you are free to go and do what you want and where you want. Just note that the further dungeons you skip to, the harder it will be on you since you may have fewer hearts early in the game. \nNow as for secrets, here is a list:\n- 2 HC Pieces on each major island\n- 4 HC Pieces in 4 separate mini-dungeons found underwater in the vast ocean\n- 6 Magic upgrades on 6 minor islands\n- 8 Bomb upgrades on 8 major islands\n- 3 Extra required dungeons including the new optional Master Dome\n- Tons and Tons of rupees found on land, underwater, or found by defeating all enemies on certain overworld screens.\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Use beta 183 to play this!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nVer. 1.3 - Added more raft paths to make the overworld a bit more accessible. Added some more free super bombs due to complaints of players. Decreased the price on super bombs and magic shields in shops around the overworld. Should play smoother now.\nVer. 1.4 - Added a new mini-dungeon and added another raft path. Fixed  some more bugs and finished up with the suggestions made from the forums.\nVer. 1.5 - Fixed a potion shop in the 'dead town' so those player with no potions leftover from level 8 can have some relief.\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Tried to squash as many Level A, B, C continue bugs as possible, even to the point that you can no longer start in those dungeons anymore. I hope the problem is fixed now. Also made general detail touch ups across the board.\nUpdate: Replaced the missing readme file mentioned in this description!",

While not quite as difficult as AlphaDawg's \"ZC official\" 3rd Quest, it will still provide Zelda experts with a considerable challenge and lots of interesting puzzles.\n\nFor those of you who are not *quite* skilled enough to consider yourselves Zelda \"experts,\" the quest comes with a complete FAQ/walthrough, written in question-hint-answer format, so that it won't take away the fun of figuring things out yourself.\n\nMaster Quest was built from BS 1st, as you can see, but numerous subtle improvements have been made including custom tiles, layering, landscape \"manicuring,\" area-specific MIDI themes, a new overworld palette, and even lowercase letters!  As for big changes, there is an entirely new overworld area for you to find and explore, and of course every dungeon is a completely new level.\n\nTo maintain the \"old school\" feel, I've purposely used only the original Zelda items, enemies, and bosses, and most of the other Zelda conventions from the original game still apply. The best way to prepare for Master Quest is to replay the original 2nd Quest. \n\nDespite these limitations, Master Quest's dungeons are huge compared to the original Zelda. It should provide even speedy players with more than 10 hours of gameplay.",

So in a way, this quest has been in the making for 16 years. Enjoy. ",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- When in doubt, remember back to the original Zelda games to determine what should and shouldn't be possible.\n- Bomb every wall.\n- Burn every bush.\n- Play your ocarina on occasion.\n- Press against dungeons walls often. Some of them are false walls.\n- If there are items you *know* you will need eventually, try to buy or find them as early as you can. MQ GREATLY rewards foresight.\n- Refer to the subscreen map often in dungeons. Mark unexplored areas, and remember where you need to go.  Backtrack often!\n- If you're stuck, search the overworld for hint-giving old men.  In MQ they really are helpful!\n\nIf all else fails, check the FAQ included in the zip file for hint-a-licious assistance.",

    "description": "(This quest was created by Phantom Menace and completed by Nightmare...)Back in 1999, Phantom Menace and I were working together on Zelda Classic (pretty much just us), and we made two separate quests. One was New Quest (mine) as everyone knows, the other was the Demo Quest, supposedly the try-out field for new features BEYOND Zelda Classic. As you know, New Quest was honored and remembered.Sadly, for our creator of Zelda Classic, Demo Quest never got finished as PM got sidetracked.So in the summer of 2004, five years later, I asked for permission to finish off Demo Quest to satisfy the urges of the oldbies wanting to save Zelda in that quest, as well as make it playable (if you thought James Quest 2 or Mega Man: DWR DC were hard, pick up Demo Quest from the AGN DB. Makes both of those look easy!) I was successful in updating and adding a lot of ZC's new features and tricks into Demo to re-create the feel it had back in 1999, with new features as well. It's also MUCH more playable now. Unfortunately, much as I love his work, PM tended to be a much better Zelda player than me and his quests were designed that way. Everyone should have a chance now rather than just 3-4 players.Updated 02/09/05 to fix bug in Level 4.Updated April 2015 to version 2.50.Patch 3 Notes 5/31/20171. Wizzrobes fixed2. Some warps fixed3.

When the head goes to the other side, the fire will be out of range. Move up, throw sword beams, go back to the corner until it's out of range.

    "description": "Here is Molka, a Quest I finished 2 or 3 years ago. Now you're probably thinking, \"Old graphics? Are you kidding me?\" Well, here's my wisdom; this Quest will prove that Quests can still be good if they're in the old graphics. This Quest contains 13 levels (all required to win) and a whole lotta things to uncover. Along with the old gfx are many custom-drawn gfx that I drew myself (the gfx themselves weren't all that hard to draw; it's the COMBOS that really rock), and also don't forget that the music that comes with this Quest is, in more than my own opinion, excellent.\n\nBefore you begin, remember that this Quest is a challenging one. The levels are not ridiculously hard, but they do make you think. Lots of puzzles are in this Quest...  trust your gizmos.\n\nSo, for your enjoyment, I give you...  MOLKA!!\n\n***Updated 8/14/07*** Fixed some long-outstanding bugs, such as not being able to exit from a later dungeon until you've beaten it (and that dungeon required Bait too, so O_o on that), various Continue bugs (though they're not eliminated, they are now no longer game-stopping) and I also removed the things the Bosses say to you when you fight them 'cause Link can't move and the Boss often can get in a free hit. Not cool. Lastly, I added 4 new screenshots. ",
    "story": "Molka is a mountain land, inhabited by strong, hearty folks. This land was peaceful enough, as Ganon had never touched the place. Well, THAT'S because Ganon did NOT know that Molka had a triforce of it's own! The Triforce of Gizmos allowed it's owner mastery over his or her items. Link could've used something like this in his first adventure, couldn't he? Well, also in Molka were new items that Link or anyone in Hyrule had never heard of before. The Whistle of the Winds was an example.\n\n  Ganon always seems to revive himself after being defeated, huh? It's true. Link and Ganon have faced off so many times it's not even funny. (That's thanks to anyone who's ever made a Zelda Classic Quest!) So, Ganon revives himself again and goes at it, thinking of another way to defeat Link. After 3 days of thinking, Ganon bolts out of his chair and yells, \"I HAVE IT! I know how to defeat Link! I just have to kidnap Zelda to a land with tougher enemies!\" All his minions applauded. What a plan! It was brilliant!\n\n  Ganon sent out scouts to find a land with really hard enemies. They found one: Molka. \"Great job, boys!\" Ganon said to the scouts. \"Let's prepare to strike!\" And with that, Ganon and his minions started building the Dark Base, a floating dungeon that could travel anywhere. In 2 weeks, it was finished. Ganon took Zelda the next night, as she was walking out on her balcony to gaze at the stars, and transported her up into the Dark Base. Then they flew to the mountain of Molka, putting Ganon's plan fully in action. Ganon just had to wait for Link.\n\n  The Hyrulians didn't panic. This has happened before. Zelda's been kidnapped a lot, so they knew the drill. Rebuild the Triforce, send Link to Level 9, defeat Ganon. Right? Well, that's when the Hyrulian messenger reported that Ganon escaped to Molka. OOPS, this ain't part o' the drill! NOW they panicked. But Link didn't. Already he was thinking of a way to get to Molka.\n\n  He went home that night with no plan. His sidekick, a Wind Wizzrobe (who he met secretly in A Link to the Past), tried to cheer him up a bit. He knew how to play Link's whistle better than Link, so he played a song for him. Link didn't cheer up. \"I've been on many adventures before, but Molka...  I don't even know where Molka is!\" The Wizzrobe stopped playing and looked at Link, hard. \"Did you say, MOLKA?\" Silence. \"Link, I lived in Molka during your first adventure! I know where it is!\"\n\n  By the next day, Link was prepared to go. The laws of Molka stated that most Hyrulian items were not allowed within the land. So, Link was bringing his Boomerang, Wooden Sword, and a Blue Potion with him. Even the Red Ring stayed behind. Once he was all ready, the Wind Wizzrobe blew him in a tornado to the city in Molka. It worked!\n\n  Now, Link knew where he had to go. The Triforce of Gizmos, still undetected by Ganon, was hid away hundreds of years ago in 8 pieces, each piece inside one of the dangerous Forts of Molka. These Forts also contained legendary Molkian items (like the Whistle of the Winds), allowing Link even more power. Only once Link had completely mastered his items would he be able to reach the Dark Base floating over the northeastern corner of Molka. And the best part is, Ganon doesn't even know Link is prepared so well. He doesn't know what he's askin' for!!!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "-Molka's Forts are chalk full of secret passages. Try getting the Map as soon as possible so you can find these passages better. Even without the Map, once you've gotten far enough in the Quest, you'll just know where things are.\n\n -Ganon's right about tougher enemies. In the later levels, you may be fighting a whole room of Blue Darknuts, or even 4 Manhandlas! There are Potion shops about, MAKE GOOD USE OF 'EM.\n\n -Statues are everywhere on the mountain. Use an item on them that they relate to, to clear a path. Memorize the paths on this mountain, learn 'em well. As you collect items from the Forts, you'll definitely need to move backward in order to move forward.\n\n -You can carry a maximum of 20 Bombs, once you find the shops. Some items are extremely rare and not required to win. The Magic Key can be bought for 980 Rupees. See, you weren't meant to have it! Try the Gold Ring instead. It's only about 700 Rupees.  \n\n-Like I said above, I made a \"workaround\" for the continue bug if you're using 2.10 instead of 1.92, but this still starts you out in the Boss Room. If you want to stop fighting the Boss over and over and get a potion or whatever, you still have to Quit->Save. It's the best I could manage to be compatible with both 1.92b and 2.10. Nothing major though.",

It uses many of the newer items used in Zelda Classic and should be played using version 2.10.\n\nUpdate: Fixed a warp bug in the mountains that would let the player access the Dark World earlier than planned which can be almost game ending.",
    "story": "Princess Zelda knew that she didn't have much time until evil returned to the land of Hyrule. She decided to head out to a remote island, far from Hyrule, where she could safely hide the Triforce of Wisdom from the clutches of evil. She told no one of her plans except for her noble aid, Impa. As Zelda was trying to hide the last four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom on the island, she was captured by a renegade group of Moblins in the forest. The Moblin tribe was attempting to create an entrance to the Dark World so they could once again be together with their master, Ganon. The Moblins were successful and were able to open a path to the Dark World and turned Zelda over to Ganon. Ganon knew that it wouldn't be long before Link learned of Zelda's fate, so he scattered the other four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom throughout the Dark World. Ganon then commanded the rest of his minions find the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom Zelda hid so that he could claim them as his own. Back in Hyrule, there was much concern when the princess was reported as missing for a long period of time. Impa then decided to seek help with Link, the Hero of Time. When Link learned of Zelda's capture, he immediately set out to rescue her from Ganon's clutches. On the way to the island, his ship was damaged in a storm and he lost all his possessions, becoming shipwrecked on the island. Starting his adventure without even having his trusty sword at his side, Link must find a way to navigate this new island to find the princess and rescue her from Ganon.",

It was originally made before you could link strings together, so in order to get the full story and talk to other characters, you have to pay for info a lot.  But I provide lots of rupees, so don’t worry.  The quest is about Metroids and Samus with cameos from other characters.  It is fairly simple and linear.  It consists of Samus traveling to a series of different planets on her quest to catch Ridley.  The dungeons start out easy, but get a little harder toward the end.  At the very end, I decided that the very last dungeon (with Fett) was a little hard, so I provided a way to view a fast ending in case you don’t want to play all the way through the last dungeon.  But if you do stick with it and beat the entire game, you get a much more rewarding ending.  The storyline may seem a little similar to Meitroid Prime: Hunters, because it’s about Samus battle other bounty hunters, but I actually finished this quest many years before the DS ever came out.  I'm only just now getting around to redoing some tiles and uploading it.",

    "description": "This is my Zelda Classic Quest story, that I started. It will have at least three chapters, maybe four, depending on where I go with the third chapter.  WARNING. This quest starts off relatively hard, then lulls you into a false sense of being easy, and then bombards you with the near impossible at the end. Needless to say, it is not for the average Zelda Classic player. So don't complain, you've been warned.",
    "story": "This chapter is sort of an adaptation of many of the LOZ stories. It begins where Link just beat Ganon to save Zelda. However, just because Ganon was defeated and encapsulated in stone doesn't mean that Ganon's minions are gone. On the way back to Hyrule Castle, Link was mobbed by a massive amount of darknuts. Unfortunately, the darknuts overwhelmed Link, and took all of his goods and Zelda. Now Link must save Zelda wherever she is. Link also recalls that Zelda told him of a 'blue Triforce' that, when combined, would let the worthy claim the true Triforces of Power, Courage, and Wisdom. Now Link must set off to save Zelda and claim the 'blue Triforce'.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Tip 1: Don't get frustrated. This quest is not designed to be completed in five minutes. In fact the fastest run I made wasn't less than 10 hours. It is also designed to be tough, but not too tough. So if you are dying consistently, then either you need more hearts or better equipment. Tip 2: Explore everywhere! HCP's are direly needed in the quest as you don't get Heart Containers. The problem is that I counted the number of HCP's and the count comes out different each time. (it is between 81-84 but it really doesn't matter, you'll see why toward the end of the game.) So keep playing. Tip 3: PAY FOR THE HINTS!!! This will REALLY help your progression in the quest. Also, for those who can't get through, I will be making a walkthrough on a site here in the not so distant future, so keep your eyes open. If you have any questions, post them and I will see how to answer them to the best of my ability.\nwww.geocities.com/darthpikachu21/Level1.html",

The Red Candle is needed to reach Level 5.\n3. You'll find the White Sword and Magic Sword in small dungeons with Gleeoks blocking them.\n4. Ganon's tower is 9 floors, you basically have to traverse around 100 total rooms to reach Ganon. He appears twice so be careful.\n5. In rooms with 10 different enemies, make sure you have a potion or full health. There are no fairy ponds in this game so be careful.\n6. Search every room in every dungeon! \n7. Don't be upset if the game is shorter or easier than you imagined. This is my very first quest ever made and I might've screwed up, but enjoy.\n8. Don't worry, the quest is very beatable, but takes some adjusting.\n9. Enjoy the ending.\n10. If the item is stuck on the walls, don't worry about it. Those aren't really needed to beat the game.",

ETC. ETC. \n\t\nStory:\n\tthe story starts out as most of wario's bussness ventures do. one day he's laying on the couch and he sees an advertisement on TV. \"NEW! FROM GAMECO! the massivly multiplayer online RPG smash hit that everyone's talking about! WORLD OF EVERLIFE 2! play with people from around the globe! incredibly addicting! only $50 and an additonal $15 a month!\" \n\tso then the microscopic peanut that is wario's brain acheves the following train of thought; \"hey! if I make an addictive-a smash hit thingey, mabey I can-a charge ridiculous amounts of a-money! and the best part is that they'll-a PAY MY HUGE FEES NO MATTER WHAT! but who should I a-chose to be in charge of the project, hmmm... Mona has a job at that pizza place, Jimmy likes go a-goof of and a-dance insted of a-work, Dribble is too big, Spitz is-a to short, orblon only has-a 3 fingers, Dr. Crygor is to-a... err... never mind him, Wait! I have it! I'll get 9-volt to a-do it! he a-loves nintendo games-a so much he cant say no to me! unless Mario (blech!) a-tells him not-a to. but what are the odds of-a that? mwa ha ha! I'm so smart!\" \n\tjust as wario expected, 9-Volt agreed to make the game so 9-Volt got a new computer with a 999 Gigahertz pressesor,a 500 gigabyte hard drive, and a neat-o USB controller. a few weeks later, the game was open for a private Gamma test (a gamma test is like a beta test only more so) and 9-volt just finished tranfering his entire NES game collection to the hard drive of the computer when 9-volt, to his horror acidently hit the \"transfer all dowloaded data to game and scatter about in the form of the Triforce\" button (who's Idea was to put a button that did that?) so 9-volt went and played the game to find all 8 peces of the triforce, and at the same time stop the illigal hacking going on in the game. \n\t9-volt thought \"let's start in hyrule....",

I put a lot of side quests in the quest so it can have a feel to most Zelda games. The storyline fits into the major storyline and I do try to connect them all together. I spent a lot of time on the storyline and I hope you like it. This is what you can expect from the quest:-Travel through huge Forests, islands, caves, deserts, graveyards, mountains, towns, as well as Dreams.-Come face to face to some of the old Hero's of Hyrule.-Meet different cultures and races of Hyrule.-Fight some original custom bosses like Wolfblin and King Dodongo.-Play some great mini games like bow and arrow target practice and rafting.-See some original puzzles never seen in ZC.-Huge Dungeons with different themes.-and More!10/12/2011 Update - 5 years later, I came back and polished the game up. Here are some of things I added:-Donmore's Cave is redesigned!-Wondering Tree is redesigned!-The Thieves' Hideout is redesigned!-The Irony Cave is redesigned!-The Grave Cave is added.-New puzzles in some of the levels, as well as some hints to make puzzles more clear.-String Count went from 1400 to 2000!-Cave of Ordeals added!-Extra Level and Extra Ending for those Hardcore players!-And a lot more... But play the game to find out!11/3/2013-Few bug updates. Gohma 4 is no longer in my game... *runs*3/17/2015-Fixed a bug in Cave of Ordeals.  No other updates.",
    "story": "On a small island just outside of Hyrule lived a boy named Link. As he grew up, he knew he was destined to become the new Hero of Hyrule. The Robins who were neighbors of Link, told him that the bloodline of the Hero’s past through him. He knew that on any given day his adventure could begin.One day Link was drawing a picture of a sword on the mountainside of the island. He looked down at his shield that he always kept with him, and thought how cool it would be to finally use it with a sword of his own. Just then his good friend Patty walked over to him. She looked a little sad, as she told him that she was going to leave the island soon in search for the Shooting Star Legend. In that moment, they both looked at the shoreline and noticed that the water was acting very violent. But they brushed it off. As Link finished the drawing, he signed his name on the bottom of the sword. Patty was still talking about that legend; however, Link couldn’t keep his eyes off the coastline, which was getting worse by the second.Little did they know, the Dark Army had just docked south of the city of Fulton. The Commander of the Army stepped out to dock while discussing the plan to this staff, “Continue searching for the remaining Triforce pieces. We will capture Fulton and await you there!” As the Commander looked at the path to Fulton, he whispered to himself, “And now it begins.”",
    "tipsAndCheats": "First of all don’t use any cheats on this game because of the amount of events I put in this game. Second this game is huge. Expect 15-25 hours on this game. If you don’t like huge games I say pass it up. Third, the game does get a little hard. I suggest you getting POTIONS whenever possible. You are going to die quite a bit, but don’t worry you will end up passing it. If you have any questions ask in the forum and I will help you out. Also make sure to read the story because they give you a lot of hints for things you need to do.\n\nAlso here is a link to my Director's Commentary on my game.

If I had the level 4 cheat available, timers can be picked up if the \"no walls\" function is on and there won't be a timer in the Mini-Game. \nIn short, the cheat code you get when you beat the quest is a Level 3 cheat.\n\nThere will be walk-through walls on dungeon levels 3-6. Here is a hint to get the legendary items in an unmapped room. Level 4, while you are about to ride the first minecart, walk-through wall is above. Go through it and you can get the Farore's Wind. Level 5, after you rode the minecart, behind the pots is a walk-through wall. Get the Nayru's love. Level 6, in a room where there is just a rectangular lava, the right side is bombable. \nEnter through it and get the magic key. Don't leave the room yet, the right wall is a walk-through to get Din's fire. The legendary items are as the items from SNES A link to the past. Bombos medallion is Din's fire, Ether medallion is Nayru's love and quake medallion is Farore's wind.\n\nThere are unmapped rooms in all dungeons where there is 10 rupies. Accessed by blowing a hole in the wall by a bomb.\n\nLink's bed at Link's house is also a life restoring room. Walk to the far right side of the bed to restore Life energy.\n\nBe sure to buy the arrows at the village before going to the level 2 dungeon. Also you may need to buy an extra key before going in dungeon levels 2, 3, 5 and 6 (even 7 but if you've found the magic key in 6, you don't have to worry).

I hope you have as much fun playing this quest as it was designing it!  \n\nUPDATED 6.8.06 Because of stupid mistake on my part.\n\nUPDATED 6.18.06 Fixed the bombable walls in Level Three.\n\nUPDATED 11.4.06 A slightly bigger update:\n\n1. Fixed the number of continue hearts from 50% to 6. Makes it a little fairer for players in the beginning but a little more difficult as you get far into the quest.\n\n2. Changed the music for Level One.\n\n3. It is now possible to find a blue potion before Level Two. Players of this quest will know what I'm talking about. My advice is to not use it until you get to Level Two. No, I didn't change the Level 2 block puzzle. Deal with it.\n\n4.

    "description": "This quest was made, completed and finished within 3 months about 8 months ago. (about March or April of this year) But it was delayed in release because Petoe and I wanted it to be a simultaneous release with Lost Isle. But since Lost Isle is being delayed for a while due to quality assurance and other issues, we decided to release this early. So technically, this was the first quest finished with the DOR tileset, but probably not the first DOR tileset quest to be released because of this. However, as a promotion for our upcoming Lost Isle in 2007, there is a hidden info guy in the quest that gives you tips not on Wolfstyle, but on Lost Isle! Just to inspire you!\nAs for the quest itself: It is a small quest with a 64 screen overworld only 7 main dungeons and a newly added Master Dome that wasn't present in the original. It is a completely remake of my very first quest the way it should have been. The overworld is expanded to fully realize the original vision and although the dungeons retain the same layout as the original, playing them is a whole different ballgame. \nThere is no special tricks or nothing fancy to interest those who are looking for something new in the ZC scene. It is simply a fun, short romp through quality Zelda that has the ability to be time-runned for those daring to make a time attack of it. \nFurthermore, I have fully implemented a difficulty setting in the quest itself! A normal mode for casual players and a hard mode for hardcore players. Don't complain about the absurdity of the challenge in hard mode, it was made for you to NOT win easily and it was made to be a bit cheap. But testers like Love for Fire and Ouch! have proven that hard mode can be beaten. If you can't take it, play normal mode like all the rest.\nChanges in hard mode: red potions are for sale instead of blue, the magic sword is for sale now and the master sword is now the prize of the Master Dome. The gold ring is now hidden somewhere.\nEnjoy!\n\nNOTE: USE BETA 183 TO PLAY THIS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUpdate 08 March 07: Made a few minor corrections in strings and edited a few graphical bugs out.\nUpdate 21 March 07: Made a major update so players wouldn't get stuck with lockblocks.",
    "story": "Basic story, collect 6 (!) triforce pieces this time and save Zelda from Ganon.\n\nHard Mode: The 6 triforce pieces aren't required in hard mode to access level 7, but you may still want to beat all 6 levels for all the tools and heart containers needed just to survive!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "The info guy hidden in the quest gives you pricey tips on special secrets found in the upcoming quest Lost Isle, not Wolfstyle DX. Just think of it as a teaser for Lost Isle and to give you a leg up on the quest when you finally do get your hands on it! \n\nVideo Walkthrough of Wolfstyle DX",

It wasn't much of a vacation. He ended up helping Mario's daughter, Karen, foil one of Bowser's plans. After his quest ended, Link was anxious to see the princess of his own land, so he quickly returned home. To his surprise, Zelda invited him to her zecret hideout, Zelda Falls, in the northwest corner of Hyrule. Link was only too happy to go, but he really should have brought more than Rupees and a shield; waiting for him was yet another adventure.\n\nUpon his arrival in Zelda Falls, Link walked through the waterfall to Zelda's cave. She presented him with a new wooden sword for his birthday. \"As if I don't already have a million of these,\" he thought to himself as he left.\n\nLess than a minute later, Link discovered a small underground palace. It was infested with enemies, but Link made short work of them. Strangely enough, Zelda was waiting for him in a room nearby. \"You have to help me Link!\" she told him. Apparently, Zelda's younger sister, Miriam, had recently gone missing. Link suspected Ganon at work, but Zelda insisted that she just wandered off. After they left the palace, Link and Zelda set out to find a young girl dear to them both...",

Besides those dungeons, there are also two linked caves, and a ninth and tenth dungeon to cap it off.\n\nEnemies in this game can get pretty... insane, to put it lightly (especially the bosses.) Don't expect to beat this game without dying, in fact abuse dying and use it to your advantage. Also, use potions. They are littered throughout the later dungeons as well as a few fairy ponds to keep you going. Get rings as soon as you possibly can. You should even be able to get the blue ring before level 2 (and you might need it...)\n\nOverall, although this quest may seem fairly linear, it should still provide a good challenge and it will definitely test your fighting skills.\n\nEdit: Continue bugs are fixed",

Not only have I updated the quest for a new tileset, but I've gone through from start to finish and made changes and improvements. Some are subtle, some are major. Overall, the game now plays even more like the original Zelda, to enhance your enjoyment of a considerable challenge.\n\nAs time has gone by, the BS tileset has evolved, and so has my quest design style. Having released the 1st and 2nd Quests unpassworded in the New BS tileset, I started to desire to remake my original ZC quest, \"Legend of Zelda: Master Quest,\" using the New BS tileset and a new way of doing things. \n\n\nNew improvements and additions include:\n\n- Completely redesigned BS Link sprites, modeled after the BS mascots and Classic Link (drawn by Dart Zaidyer and Radien).\n- Updated dungeons.\n- Truer classic-style gameplay.\n- Lowered frustration factor.\n- Redesigned level 9 featuring returning themes from 1st and 2nd Quest.\n- All known instances of the continue bug have been thwarted and eliminated.\n- Unpassworded quest file for enlightenment, amusement, and personalized play.\n- Updated companion FAQ helps you with stumper puzzles as much as ever.\n\n\nI've tested this quest extensively, and it should have fewer bugs than the original. However, beta testers were in short supply, so if you should come across ANY bug whatsoever, please tell me. I will do whatever necessary to fix the bug for you personally.",

Some of them are false walls.\n- If there are items you *know* you will need eventually, try to buy or find them as early as you can. MQ GREATLY rewards foresight.\n- Refer to the subscreen map often in dungeons. Mark unexplored areas, and remember where you need to go. Backtrack often!\n- If you're stuck, search the overworld for hint-giving old men.  In MQ they really are helpful!\n\nIf you need more help, check the FAQ included in the zip file for hint-a-licious assistance.\n\n\nAnd last but not least, if you want to cheat like crazy, open up the quest file in ZQuest and mess around to your hearts content. Since the quest is unpassworded, it uses the four standard cheat codes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. But remember, true Zelda gamers try to finish the game without cheats. ",

    "description": "Hype Description:\nThis is a complete re-envisioning of Hyrule the way it was meant to be. Old places look new and unfamiliar, dungeons you have scoured many times in the past no longer bear the same treasures or the same design. Secrets that were once common knowledge have been lost and are hidden in new locations. The entire world has changed and you have to change with it if you want to survive. This is Legend of Zelda: Origin.\n\nDeveloper Description:\nDespite people commonly dismissing many remakes or revamps or in this case, re-envisioning of the original Zelda quests, this goes far beyond what you have ever seen for the 1st and 2nd quests. First off straight from the get-go you have a choice to either start the 1st or the 2nd quest in the same quest file. There is also an option for a 3rd xtreme quest after beating the second or straight from the get-go for those insane Gung-ho players. To top it off, you have selection of choice for which dungeons you want to play over the course of Xtreme 3rd. Three Quests in one, can you handle it?\nMassive changes with everything built from scratch. Heart containers on the overworld are now divided into 15 HC Pieces, the remaining 5 scattered across mini-games which you must win to acquire them. New secret locations, new cave systems, new dungeon layouts that do not conform to the original in anything but shape, every single item in ZC is utilized and can be acquired, a new Dome of Trials has opened up in the world, the ability to save Zelda in a variety of ways and finally a special bonus challenge for those who manage to complete Xtreme 3rd. This is everything you've been wanting to see for the originals, but never saw previously in any quest thus far. This is Origin.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.c...BA&feature=plcp - Origin Video Walkthrough\n\nMay no longer work in the Lost Isle Build.",

It shouldn't be hard to figure out where to go next, and it is only moderately difficult. This quest uses old school graphics (aside from layers), with plenty of custom made tiles and whatnot. There are 18 dungeons total (15 per class) on 1 overworld map.\n\nGreat replay value.",

You can buy all sorts of useful items there.\n\nLater in the game, there is a single superbomb. Use it in the right place (it's obvious) and you can get basically infinite coins. Great for buying everything in the town.\n\nLastly, the wizard will get items like the wand, potions, and magic spells. The knight gets items like the hammer, the gold ring, and the master sword.",

    "description": "Game Info: This quest is a continuation of the other ones I've been doing, it is closer to Hyrule's Big Swamp, and Hyrule's Big Flood in its graphics. I've learned a lot about layering, and it shows here.\nThere are some new ideas incorporated into the quest, and frankly, I'm a bit proud of the result. \nWe played it through, and have found no significant bugs. Visually, I think this is one of the best quests I've ever done. So if you've been a fan in the past, this will not disappoint!",
    "story": "Hi. Here is another quest from Tlseward! Hope you enjoy it.\n\nStory: For you who don't like quests where Link goes to save Zelda from Ganon, sorry.\nLink is going to save Zelda again! He likes the smooches at the end of the quest! \nAnd Zelda needs to be saved for the 3.9 billionth time. (She likes the smooching part, too.)",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Hint sheet included. It includes a walkthrough to find each dungeon, as well as a guide to find each boss key. Locations of each item, IE each dungeons treasures are listed, but how to find them is not included. (one has to do some work to complete a quest.)",

I totally missed it, but sharp-eyed Caleb got it.\nAlso my daughter Hilary helps with graphics. \n\nOpen invitation. Anyone who wants to contribute Cowboy style graphic set, or Pirate style set\nboth for Link and for enemies, would be appreciated. It would be best if it fit into the pure tileset.",

It contains many gameplay elements from my upcoming quest Eternal Winter, so if you liked the demo for that, play this. Likewise, if you like this, play that demo.\n\nThe Tileset is a heavily modified Classic Set - the Overworld uses a Custom CSet and Custom Tiles to make a \"Snowy\" atmosphere, and dungeons include LttP Lava.\n\nThis quest has 4 Dungeons, starting easy and progressing in difficulty, where the fourth dungeon is very challenging. This quest should provide 2 or more hours of solid gameplay for any person who wants to play a quest, but doesn't have the time commitment for \"Hero of Dreams\" or any of the big-shot quests. \n\nThis quest has a solid musical score, if I do say so myself. Fitting sound gives the dungeons a good mood. No need to play with your speakers off.\n\nSo now, 2 weeks in development, I give to you \"The Legend of Zelda: The Meaning of Christmas.\"",

    "description": "This quest is, in my opinion, 2 complete overworlds and 9 full dungeons of pure Zelda. Taking 2 and a half years to construct this quest, expect to have anywhere from 15 to 30 or more hours of solid gameplay. The difficulty is not over-the-top, yet you'll encounter many interesting puzzles, many of which are totally new to Zelda. This quest includes almost every item; you'll find two in each of the quest's eight main dungeons and one in each mini-dungeon. You'll encounter Zelda's typical overworld areas, including a forest, lake, mountain, swamp, snowy mountain, and more. You can also amass a full 16-heart life gauge and a full 8-unit magic meter. Additionally, I've taken great care in making sure that grammar is perfect and that directions are as clear as possible.\n\nNote: I strongly suggest that you do not use a 2.5 beta to play this quest, as you will encounter several compatibility bugs that may inhibit you from completing the quest. Please use version 2.10. \n\nRegardless, I hope that you truly enjoy Link to the Heavens and that you have a load of fun. Many already have, so don't miss your chance.\n\nLast update: 9/15/09. This update will likely be my last, as it fixes a few minor miscellaneous errors or inconsistencies.",

I put very little directions in the game to keep with the original's style.  \n\nI recommend playing this in 2.10.2.  It will mess up level 3's MIDI, but I couldn't find a better midi that didn't do the same thing.  All of the others work fine.\n\nWARNING:  This can be a VERY CHALLENGING quest from what everyone has told me. It was actually more challenging than what I thought it would be for everyone.  \n\nUPDATE: Golden arrow shop is now a special item room- so it's obtainable now;  level 9 typo- fixed; small detail tiles added in as well;  \n\nPer requests: Faster scrolling dungeons/overworld; 2 more hidden bomb upgrade shops -now for a total of 4 upgrades!  \n\n\n2nd UPDATE: Level 4 map is now accessible.

Tons of songs arranged from a variety of old games.The overworld should look a little familiar, I got the idea looking through the packaged booklets from my old Zelda cartridges. I made the game easy to moderate difficulty I guess, it's hard to tell.

    "story": "Story, abridged version....Somewhere between Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on the timeline:Ganon appeared out of nowhere. He stole the triforce, but luckily the triforce of wisdom had been split up across the land to keep him from getting his hands on it. He waited for somebody else to do his work for him. Ganon attacked the newly built North Castle and took it for myself. Luckily, the King had not had a chance to move everything and make it his new home.The forces of Hyrule were divided, although most of them stood in the Great Palace, an old castle where the kings of Hyrule have ruled for generations. There was one village that had to actually move from their homes into the nearby mountains. A small entourage protects a young swordsman of the Link bloodline as he travels from the Great Palace to the hidden safety of New Kasuto, and was ambushed along the way. He finds himself unarmed at the entrance of a cave with enemies all around him.",

Use the whistle to open a portal to the beginning.- When you die or quit, you start out with full health, which is great for dungeons. Do you need to get back to one of the rooms near the entrance, but don't want to go through all those rooms to get back? There's no downside to strategically quitting and continuing (unless you're trying to collect rupees or refill bombs along the way back).- Walkthrough.... I can't make it any easier than that.",

I played through so many times I'm sick of looking at the quest.this is version 0.81BUG FIX: info shops used wrong stringsthis version 0.9FATAL BUG FIX: L9 1st Floor got stuck. I used an apparently-unintended exploit (the x makes it sound cool) of the room rules for it to work. When the bug was identified and removed in v2.5x, my exploit broke, and you couldn't get through the room. Running old zc v2.10, you are able to get through L9. It looks like this has been broken in 2.5x since at least 2016, but probably was somewhere in the beta before 2.5x's official release.bug fix: A locked door in L9 2nd Floor should have been 1-way instead of shutter on the other side. It acted as an unintended trap to make you repeat rooms, if you didn't have the magic key and if you took a particular route, although it was just an annoyance. Now the door is no longer a trap.bug fix: A re-enabling bubble was missing from the Secret Grave dungeon in the large graveyard.bug fix: Rocks were added north of North Castle to prevent somebody from getting stuck.rebalancing: Added re-enabling bubbles to a room next to the starting room of all dungeons/minidungeons that have permanently-disabling bubbles somewhere in them.rebalancing: Ruto magic game, the crazy impossible room has a second target you can hit and the timed warp has been removed.aesthetic: One overworld screen had a black square under the armos instead of the same tile as the ground.typo: Fixed the name of Midoro Palace on the dungeon map.typo: Fixed ending credits link to PureZC.",

Soshi's Quest has a complete 8X16 over world, two smaller mountain overworlds at each side of the main one, and 18 levels, 9 regular, 9 bonus.",
    "story": "Long ago, on a far away planet, there was a peaceful society called Soshi Valley, which was inhabited by lizard creatures called Soshis. Shunned by the other Soshis, was small group of them called Dark Soshis. They believed that without living beings, the universe was perfect, that life was a waste of space. And so they dedicated their lives to killing everything on the planet that breathed. After that had achieved this, they would use their dark powers to put an end to themselves, so the universe could thrive on its own, untouched by unnatural forces. But even they knew that they could never hope to accomplish this on their own, so they combined their powers and creating an all-powerful object called the Sludge Orb. Off of it spawned a giant creature made out of a poisonous slimy substance, and he was called king sludgious. However, he was defeated when one of the Soshi elders joined the Dark Soshis, learned their dark  magic, and used it to create what came to be called the Soshi Orb, which was then used to destroy the Sludge Orb. The elders knew that if the Soshi orb fell into the wrong hands, there would be no way to stop it. So they created seven trials, and hid pieces of the Soshi orb in each one. The eight piece rested in the home of the elders.\n\nMany years later, the Dark Soshis, although were beginning to abandon their quest for universe wide death, they still lived on in secrecy, completely unaware of what their ancestors had done, until they came across an ancient book, written by one of the Soshi elders of that time. These Dark Soshis were extremely full of them selves, and thought that the Sludgiens were only defeated the first time because they weren't god enough. So they revived the Skudge Orb, spawning a new, even more powerful than the first. However, it wasted most of its power into more sludgien troops, as he was very greedy, and the Dark soshis became his slaves. So the elders did what they always do in times of darkness. They looked to ancient prophesies for help. By doing this, they found that the only way to save Soshi Vally this time was to find \"the hero by the name of his own species\" and have him complete the seven trials created by the ancient elders, retrieve the seven Soshi Orbs hidden within them, find the eighth Soshi Orb, and us them to defeat King Sludgious II. So the elders called forth Soshi, the hero by the name of his own species, to save them from certain doom before it was too late!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "After you finish the Quest, don't quit ZC just yet! Near level four is the entrance to a 100-room dungeon full of all the treasures not used anywhere else in the quest. Use the red candle on the trees in the middle of the wall in front of it, and keep going!",

    "description": "Disclaimer: This quest features NSFW content not suitable for minors.\n\nThis story type DoR quest was started one and half a year ago, aiming to reach all players and fit in the Zelda timeline right after ALttP, but eventually I patched the quest with ideas from many games (mostly Ultima, Mega Man and Final Fantasy) and created an own story, the first episode of the Bloodline Saga.\n\nThe new thing is that the main character isn't Link, rather Knil and he has a girlfriend, Myra. You can explore two worlds with them, collecting three kind of main collectibles (Triforce piece aka Lightforce piece is just one of them). Also, Ganon is entirely out from the game, the head villain is Vaati.\n\nContents:\n-Altogether about 7 and a half size of mass overworlds\n-12 mandatory big dungeons\n-8 subdungeons\n-1 mandatory minidungeon\n-3 secret dungeons\n-1 small and 2 big sidequests\n-13 custom bosses not counting the final boss\n-3 main endings and some secret ones\n-ALL items used\n-some events/plot twists heavily directed towards affecting your emotions\n-many custom enemy and item tiles\n-cameos from games and from PureZC\n\nThe first overworld starts out as almost simple, then the complexity of lands and dungeons keep increasing til the last dungeons where I needed to use 5-7 DMaps for one floor. The difficulty is quite high, but you can use ZC player tricks at many places and you also can find HCPs and bomb upgrades fast. There are graphics from many different tilesets and sprite resources, including many custom (or mostly just edited) ones. Music is partially from VGmusic, but the official maestro was Nuvo.\n\nNote that Knil&Myra's first goal is to escape from Hyrule. As soon as they accomplish that, you shall never return to the Light World, not to the Hyrule as you knew it... so if you don't get an item in Hyrule, you never can go back to it. Considering things like that only the Light World has magic containers, we can say that how you play in the beginning determines what can you do... outside of... \"Hyrule\". Before and after that, pay attention to any clues and speak with all NPCs, because the road from one mandatory place to the next one isn't framed with airstation reflectors. I provide any help you need if you stuck, so relax.\n\nThe ZIP file contains no fly, but a ReadMe file that holds important and maybe interesting information, also a new SFX.dat file with sound effects specially for BB (mostly from ALttP). Move the original SFX.dat to a safe folder, before pasting BB's SFX.dat into your 2.10 folder.\n\nThis makes me remember, use ZC2.10.0 if you want to minimalize the amount of bugs, which is, hopefully, zero if you indeed use 2.10.\n\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.bbflashsite.co.nr made by Twilight_Knight\n\nMADE IN HUNGARY\n\nEnjoy! \n\nUpdate 1: [19. Nov. '08] Fixed many bugs, including the elimination of many blank warps. Improved design at 2 places. Improved credits. There's an urgent bugfix for ALL bosses, so download as soon as possible!\n\nUpdate 2: [22. Nov. '08] Fixed many smaller and huge bugs from beginning to last dungeon. Added Hungarian and Dutch ReadMe files!\n\nUpdate 3: [03. Dec. '08] Fixed many bugs, mostly involving warps. Added cheats, I hand them to those in need (permanently stuck or such).\n\nUpdate 4: [15. Dec. '08] Various little and big bugfixes. Credit amendment.\n\nUpdate 5: [1. Apr. '09] Some huge bugs and a whole lot of graphical issues fixed.",

    "description": "No, No ZQDX for you yet lol\n\n   This was another little innovative experiment of mine, inspired by the swordless runs of 1st and 2nd. They usually use all sorts of things to run through dungeons and grab something to use in place of a sword, usually going through a lot of danger. Well, this quest is ALL ABOUT that. \n\n  Level 9 is available to you from the beginning. In fact, it's not even that far from where you start. However, Level 9 is still Level 9, and still as hellish as ever (And also twice as big!!) It's essentially a long road of endurance. \n\n So you can go in Level 9. But can you beat it? Well, assuming you have a sword and a bow, you can IN THEORY meet the Silver arrow on your way through and kill Ganon with just those. But you'll probably die instead. A lot. \n\n  So, here's the catch!! There are eight dungeons dedicated to eight items, plus a ton of stuff scattered around the overworld. If death just isn't you, you're gonna have to do some questing.  \n\n  The game also uses a system of statues. The Triforce doesn't play any real role in this quest, but as an item will allow you to whistle warp to these statues after you walk into them once. There are eight statues (duh) on the overworld, and if you die in an area of the overworld, you will be returned to this statue, instead of starting way back at the beginning. \n\n\n...oh, and Link talks. nyahahahaha     Also, You'll notice I have pink lava. It's mysterious!!!    AHAHAHAHAHA",
    "story": "Things have been quiet in the big cities and towns around Hyrule, and Ganon has been missing for a few months now. \n\n   Link and Zelda were about to do some work fixing up the kingdom when they received word from a sentry that several monsters were seen surrounding a castle, kinda in the middle of nowhere. Nobody seemed to care a whole lot, given that they didn't really bug people, but it didn't sit right at all with Link. or Zelda. \n\n   Zelda sent Link to the boring town to investigate. The town and the land surrounding it may be in the middle of nowhere, but there is a bright and colorful city located in the high mountains, quite away from it. It has some good supplies, but the little town has...       well, it has next to nothing. This is unfortunate, but Link must endeavor, and with no idea what Ganon is doing, he must Get in Level 9 and stop Ganon as quickly as he safely can, which may be a pretty long time.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Since you need it to kill Ganon anyways, I'll tell you that the bow dungeon is deep in the forest to the west of town. \n\n  Also, since the dungeons in this game do not have Triforce pieces as a goal, the compass markers are used for other things, like dungeon solutions, special item locations, etc. If a dungeon has you confused, LOOK FOR THE COMPASS!!

    "description": "The long-awaited (at least by me) and often-delayed sequel of Bikdip's Adventure is finally completed! Please don't let the crappiness of the first quest deter you from trying this one out. It was my first quest, and I didn't really know what I was getting into. This one is infinitely better in all aspects. It features all of the following:\n\n* 9 Complete Levels, each with a distinct theme - some standard dungeon, some sidescrolling, and some \"other\"\n* Cutscenes to progress the plot - they don't appear until after Level 6, but there are several of them at the end\n* Connectivity with the first Bikdip's Adventure\n* A noteworthy plot with several twists along the way \n* A Bonus Level that you can unlock on the title screen\n* Lots of hidden secrets\n* And it was (mostly) made in the primitive ZC 1.90! I made the decision early on to make the quest in 1.90 because I wanted to prove that even with old software, games can still be made interesting and fun to play. It's just like how the original Zelda (and other NES games) could be great even with limited technology. However, due to technical difficulties, the quest had to be split into two segments. After beating the first, you will find a url that tells you where to get the second. The second part is to be played in 1.92 b 183 if possible.\n\nPlease don't judge the whole quest by the beginning. It was made three years ago and may not feature all the interesting tricks and such that are in the later parts of the quest. That is not to say it starts out badly, or boring, but keep in mind it gets better. Also refrain from rating the quest until you get through most or all of it, and don't rate it a 0 because you hated a certain, small part of it. That isn't fair.\n\nThis quest is best played in 1.90. I strongly suggest you play it with that version unless your computer absolutely cannot run it. If that is the case, 1.92 is bearable. 2.10 is completely out of the question. You will encounter SEVERE bugs if you use 2.10. For later beta and alpha versions, use them at your own risk - I have not tested any.\n\nA lengthy readme included in the download should answer most of your questions. I suggest that you read it, or at least skim through most of it. If you want specific information about how the different ZC versions run the quest, need help with a level or the game in general, want to know where an item is, or just read about the quest's history, the readme is your friend.\n\nThe contents of the ZIP file are as follows:\n* BA2_EB.qst - the quest itself\n* BA2.sav - a .sav file with BA1 beaten for those who didn't / don't want to play that quest. Rename your current SAV file to something else, then rename this one \"zelda.sav\" to use it without overwriting your old one.\n* The readme file - should be viewed in Notepad.",
    "story": "The main character of this game is named Bargo, and he is a Bikdip, which is basically a three-eyed happy face.\n\nBefore the first Bikdip's Adventure, he was on a journey with some other Strange Creatures when he suddenly appeared in this new world. He had no idea what was going on other than a few strange thoughts he suddenly had. \"Collect the Triforce Pieces ... Save Zelda ... Defeat Ganon...\" He didn't know what any of this meant, but he traveled through the world, solving puzzles and killing monsters, completing all three of those things. This world was at peace and he could return home, right?\n\nWrong. Ganon had miraculously managed to survive. He used the last of his power to knock out Bargo, freeze Zelda to the spot, and scatter the pieces of the Triforce once again. Completely weakened, he stole all of Bargo's possessions and went into hiding.\n\nBargo awoke, still next to Zelda at the end of the final dungeon. He knows that if he ever wants to get home, he has to revive Zelda. So now his quest picks up where it left off, and he must find all the Triforce Pieces again and defeat Ganon for good.\n\nFollowing Level 6, you will view a cutscene that unveils Ganon's schemes. He is slowly making a triumphant return, and a new villain is introduced. Your overall goal in the quest will be quite different from then on. From there, the plot advances even further, most notably in the last level. You'll have to play the quest to find out what happens.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "The readme covers this pretty well. Please consult it for tips and hints.\n\nThere is a Level 1 Cheat hidden in the quest. If you find it, you can use it in the last level or throughout the whole quest if you ever play it again.\n\nThere is also a complex series of secrets stemming from the Bonus Level. If you finish the game 100%, you will be rewarded for your efforts. (Getting 100% does not necessarily mean finding all the Heart Pieces, or even the cheat code)\n\nLevel 5 is a large maze. It is possible to view the in-game map there, but some versions of ZC will crash if you open the map twice in one playthrough. Because of this, you may want to create your own map out of screenshots while playing it.",

For those on slower connections or computers, don't despair! The quest still has a high quality MIDI soundtrack, as well.\n\nAs of V1.1 on July 27th, 2016, I've opted to package the trackers with the quest in hopes it'd get more people using them, as it seems like most people just run with the MIDI soundtrack. You can still grab the module files at this link. You will need an archive reader that supports the RAR format to export these songs. If you want the quest file without any trackers, you can grab it here.\n\nIf you're stuck in Level 8 with no hope of escape, replace your quest file with this one. It should fix the issue.

Alas, I expect you guys to play and enjoy my quest for I'm mainly focusing on design and little details of every screen.

You are in a different location of Hyrule this time around, in western Hyrule also known as Tinville's section of Hyrule where it's a little warmer and a now defunct mining company was the ruler of the area. Don't worry, there aren't much differences from the Hyrule you're all used to. Basically, Link's in a new section of Hyrule, has to gather the three sections of the Triforce, and save the princess.

That's fine; 2.50 runs it just as well!\n\nWARNING\nQuest contains suggestive text strings and \"jokes\" that may not be appropriate for a younger audience. Some things in the quest could even potentially be construed as stereotypical or bigoted, albeit on a very mild scale. Most probably won't agree with that notion, but I advise against playing this if you are easily offended.\n\n\nUPDATE (06-10-13)Aesthetical changes; some palette tweaks, cleaner sprite flashing, and tidier-looking water.Game icon changed from the white pill to resemble a more traditional ibuprofen tablet.Item dungeon rearranged to a symmetrical layout.\nUPDATE (04-03-10)Re-enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot, because without that enabled, you can't reflect magic with the fire boomerang! Oops!\nUPDATE (04-02-10)Tweaked the DMap title of the last dungeon. Wait, to what? I just forgot the hyphen in it!Changed the game icons to resemble a typical white-capsule pill.Zelda 3-styled boomerang/hookshot disabled; items no longer get \"pulled\" to you by those items, but rather, they're instantly acquired when the item touches it.Other small adjustments: Nudged Link's horizontal walking, blue potion resembles half-full red, slight green/red tweak in the forest palette, small volume boost to \"Dark Werld\", removed floor borders around the lava in the first block-puzzle room of the final dungeon, ...and removed one bat from a screen in the third dungeon.\nUPDATE (08-18-09)Was an error in which you could get stuck in the third dungeon. Fixed.\n\nThis quest was inspired by a 3-hour quest concept by Aslion, but was primarily inspired by Rambly's I Hate Mayonnaise. Sadly, I ended up taking about 30-40 hours to create it because I'm slow, and I get sidetracked often. Not to mention I actually bothered with detail. Ironically, I used 1.90-style mountains, and the quest is only about two hours long. \n\nIt is named after an inflammation-reducing pill, which I happened to have a container of on my desk at the time. Being the first thing I saw when trying to think of a name, that's what I decided to go with. The name is not relevant to the quest otherwise.\n\nIt's about average difficulty, but spikes in the last dungeon.",

Both of these rooms are 10-rupee rooms and one that contains an optional item, respectively.

All of these items are completely optional, but they will make the game much easier. And for clarification, there is a secret room in the optional dungeon before the final, but the rule of symmetry does not apply in this case.If a concealed entrance on the overworld looks a bit too simple to uncover, you probably shouldn't go inside.There are a total of 12 hearts in this quest.Every B-button item slot can be filled. There is no blue candle, or regular arrows.The Lens of Truth drains rupees.Equipment obtainable includes: White/magic/master swords, magic book, flippers, blue/red/gold rings, magic/mirror shields, power bracelet, ladder, and boots. You begin with the small wallet and the \"letter\".The level 1 cheat is hidden in the quest. I will not disclose what it is, or where it is located.And for those whom didn't know already, if the quest author has enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot rule, the magic boomerang blocks magic, and the fire boomerang reflects it. To tell if this rule is enabled, items will be \"pulled\" back to you when they make contact with the boomerang or hookshot. If they're instantly acquired, the rule is off. The rule is enabled in this quest. Please don't forget it!",

There's several little things that Link's first Gameboy outing has in common with the original Zelda, and it was with that concept in mind that I took 2.10's default tileset and pushed it.It seems to be a theme with me that I can never make ANYTHING purely in 1st: there's always a color modification or a redrawn sprite... In the case of this quest, several (but not all) palettes were dulled down a bit, giving the game a sort of \"minty\" feel, like what you'd find playing the original game on a Super Game Boy/Game Boy Player/GBC (not the DX version!) This was done both to go along with the theme of Link's Awakening, and to make the quest just a little easier on the eyes.The game retains its story, although the drama doesn't build up quite as much as it should. To make up for this, the final battle sets itself upon a crumbling platform as the sun sets and Koholint slowly fades away. Link, you're a bastard.Overall, this quest is kind of a workshop of sorts. Unencoded, it can be played through, or you can do with it as you please in ZQuest. It's a sort of Skeleton (Stalfos?) quest.

    "description": "Sometime after the original version of Neverending Fantasy was released, I wanted to make a simpler-structured quest that had a ZC newcomer-friendly feel to it. I say this because, at the time, I noticed a lot of quests were really confusing without any real sense of direction, even at the very beginning for their own good, often to the point of shutting off my attention all-together. That being said, however, the difficulty does start to pick up around Level 4, and even gave me a run for my money around Level 7, so it should be playable even for ZC veterans. This quest features a standard sized overworld with 9 main dungeons, 2 secret dungeons, and quite a few elusive secrets abound. As for the changes made to 2.5, this should be it here:-Ganon can now be beaten in 2.5!-Enhanced music replacing MIDIs-BS Zelda sfx-Some minor screen changes-Boss HP has been tampered with-Trap and Zora damage output has been upped-Uses new text font-Some quest rules changed to fix some glitches-Tons of hidden rupee secretsMAJOR UPDATE!- New puzzles and key placements made in the dungeons to make them more challenging!- Caves are a bit tougher to navigate- Biggest Wallet and extra bomb upgrade are now in the game- Total heart pieces bumped from 16 to 20- Every dungeon now has a heart piece aside from the secret ones- Some graphical tile fixes- More typos squashedUPDATE 6/21/15:- Fixed bait cave bugUPDATE 7/7/15- Fixed jank block puzzle in level 2- Fixed some of the block sfxUPDATE 7/31/15- Music updated to where names are a lot less generic- Music changed for levels 4, 9, Death Mountain and Final Boss- Some vague hints added to help player in confusing puzzles- Fire Gleok has been nerfedUPDATE 8/1/15:- Some minor balances made to Level 9- Heart Container now has a unique pickup soundUPDATE 1/26/17:- Minor aesthetical changes to tile placement- block puzzle in Kakariko cave made less obnoxious- overall, if you've beaten the game at this point, not really worth playing again for this minor update as it's merely just a polish touch-up.",
    "story": "So Ganon's been dead for some time, and a remnant of his army and high general, Synrilla, aims to revive his fallen master. Legend has it that it requires the sacrifice of one the bearers of the Triforce pieces. Given the Triforce of Courage has been lost for centuries, he aims for Zelda, given she still has the Triforce of Wisdom. However, in order to spare Zelda's life, Zelda told Synrilla of the hidden pieces of the Triforce of Courage, the legendary Hero and line of descendants who has slayed Ganon in the past. A remnant of that Hero, Link, lived deep within the Woods of Tatl, and Zelda made a bargain with Synrilla that if Link were to get to hidden pieces of the Triforce of Courage, and bring them to Hyrule Castle, he would post-pone Zelda's death sentence in return for Ganon having both the Triforce pieces for the ultimate revival. Of course, Zelda has faith that Link can defeat Synrilla, and stop Ganon's revival, so upon summoning Link through telepathy, Link begins the ultimate gamble of a quest!",

Because I was slow to get the news, I had little time to submit a version myself, yet I still wanted to try.\n\nHowever, I found a few of the rules for the official fourth quest contest to be a little restricting for me.

Fortunately, by continuing on without the rules in mind, I was able to create alternate versions of the original quests with new tiles, extra music, and some extra gameplay tweaks.\n\nIn general, mapmaking is not one of my strengths; but I am not that bad of a dungeon builder.  Therefore, this quest is an alternate version of the first quest.\n\nI played this quest myself extensively and am certain everything is working right.  If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n**UPDATE 1/5/11**\nI added some new tiles and combos to improve the aesthetics, including Zelda II grass (non-mowable); made minor changes in some dungeon layouts; added a few more secrets; and, by popular demand, reduced the number of \"Door Repair\" charges.

I'd like to thank Sludge, the creator of the Cooldungeon tileset.  I loved working with it.  It was easy to use and had a lot of good tiles.  Thanks to Warlock for his sprites for the newfirst tileset.  There were a couple other guys that had made sprites that I used.

It's quite big for a first quest (9 dungeons, 3 overworlds, 24 heart containers, 1 extra dungeon, more than I can count bomb upgrades and lots of hidden money). I learned while making it so from the 1st to the 3rd dungeon its pretty basic Zelda stuff. After that is where the game really takes off. I used the original Zelda graphics because I didn't want anything flashy for a first game. But don't let that blind your judgment. If you have criticism, only post it if it's constructive and you have gotten past level 5.(That's where the game really shines). Mostly bug free. You can finish the game of course but there aren't any big bugs that will stop you. (Tested by my brother)Music is my choice so if you don't like it sorry. Overall, It's my first game( of many more to come) and have a blast!

I have tested this game many times and to my knowledge there are no bugs at all. But what it all comes down to is this.

Make sure you have bait before you beat level 8 to avoid frustration. 3. Level 8 only has 2 locked doors. Go south of both of them to find an invisible wall or bombable wall with the key's.

    "description": "I started building this quest in February of 2009 in 1.92 but moved it up to 2.10. In May 2009, I stopped working on it, until July 2010 when I began again. The tileset used was a very strange choice. You may recognize this from PolygonX8's (Exate) \"A Link to the Darkness 5\". Why I ever chose that tileset I don't know. This quest was initially a test of day to night transitions but it transformed quite quickly. A majority of this quest was worked on when I was 15. At the time I wasn't too mature, so some dialogue may seem cheesy, if not all of it. But that's what I think is the best part. The dialogue is like something you'd get out of an early 90's RPG...But this quest was my attempt to make a Zquest with a decent story, and show you players to not care so much about a great tileset. I do know how to do just about everything in Zquest, which you may not see right away. But I think this is one of those quests you should take a look at and try before you see a screenshot and say \"pass\". I was inspired a lot by Illusion of Gaia, the way heart pieces are obtained are like the red jewels. If you don't get a heart piece at a certain time, you'll never be able to get it again. So it keeps you checking areas if you want them all. There isn't tons of exploration, just like there isn't in Illusion of Gaia. Speaking of which, after I finished almost all of the quest, I played Terranigma and noticed some resemblances in the story... kind of. But anyway, enjoy if you choose to try this.",
    "story": "Once upon a time, a boy named Link was born in the kingdom of Hyrule. He grew up with his parents in Kakariko Village. They were explorers, and would take link exploring often. Some locations were dangerous, but it didn't bother them. Link would sometimes worry in his childhood where they would go, and if they were safe. In the spare time, Link would stay with his grandfather who would often take Link around caves, as he had a love for them. Link had a happy childhood, but things took a turn for the worse at the age of eleven. His parents disappeared, and many villagers rumored them to be dead. No one knew for sure. Link and his grandfather were not able to live in Kakariko Village anymore, they were too poor, and didn't want the townspeople talking about the incident, so they stayed in a cave north of the village. At the age of thirteen, it was announced that princess Zelda of Hyrule Castle was kidnapped. Link always felt after his parents left, there was nothing for him anymore, he couldn't live the same again. So he set out to rescue this princess, not caring the dangers that might face him. But what is he really getting himself into...?",

    "description": "This is my very first quest I have made, using the Classic Tileset with version 2.10. It took awhile to make this, even though I kinda just made it up as I went along, but I assure you this quest will give a good challenge to Zelda Classic players.\n\nThe quest is best played on version 2.10. I have not tested this game in 2.5, so thus if any bugs occur when playing on 2.5, please play on 2.10. Grammar is good, and there are no bugs to be seen, though if you do encounter any while playing, please let me know and I will fix them ASAP.\n\nI made this game to somewhat play like a classic NES-style Zelda game, though much like Oracle of Seasons, the game emphasizes on fighting a lot rather than puzzles, though this quest has a few that, while not head-scratching, will keep the gameplay fresh, or at least I am hoping. The quest provides the staple 9 dungeons to complete, plus several side dungeons you'll go through along the way.\n\nI hope you all enjoy my first quest!\n\nEDIT: Fixed a bug. Beforehand, if you went back to a Triforce room after getting the Triforce, you'd be stuck. I fixed that with adding in a portal in the Triforce room so you can leave easily.\nEDIT 2: Added respawn points in the Triforce rooms should people go back to them and save there. This should solve the issue of people suddenly vanishing in said rooms when they restart the game from there. Hopefully this should be the last bug fix for this. Sorry for any inconvenience!",

When he awoke, he found himself in an unfamiliar place.\n\nLink later finds out he's on the distant continent of Elmingarde, which is under siege by an evil warlock. Seeing no other option, Link sets out to free this land and release the seal on Elmingarde's goddess, Solaria.",

    "description": "Two years ago, ZeldaClassic.com held a contest for an official fourth quest to be included in the release version of Zelda Classic 2.5. Because I was slow to get the news, I had little time to submit a version myself, yet I still wanted to try.\n\nHowever, I found a few of the rules for the official fourth quest contest to be a little restricting for me. These were mostly aesthetic issues, such as graphics and music, but some involved gameplay elements as well. Fortunately, by continuing on without the rules in mind, I was able to create alternate versions of the original quests with new tiles, extra music, and some extra gameplay tweaks.\n\nAfter creating DaDoc540's 1st Quest Remix, I decided to create a remix of the second quest, which is what I present to you here.  The dungeon locations are mostly different from those of Doc's 1st, requisite items are harder to both locate and obtain, and more traps and hazards reside in the dungeons.  The difficulty curve of this quest is certainly steeper than the last one, but not too steep.  You have been warned…\n\nI played this quest myself extensively and am certain everything is working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can.\n\n**WARNING!**\nThis quest is more difficult than the previous one, so do not try this quest under the following circumstances:\n-You do not have the experience of completing various quests of high difficulty.\n-You have trouble fighting certain difficult enemies, namely Blue Darknuts and Wizzrobes.  (Only classic enemies are used here.)\n-You have great difficulty in finding hidden secrets.\n-You have Wile E. Coyote syndrome (i.e. unable to quit something until you complete it)\n\nPlease do not rate this quest with a score based solely on the difficulty.  If you can handle the difficulty, this should provide a worthwhile challenge.\n\n**Update**  vravelo brought my attention to a major bug in Level 9 that can trap the player.  The bug should be removed.  My apologies!",

    "tipsAndCheats": "You will be without a sword at the beginning for a short time.  Listen to the advice of the Old Man at the first screen to find both the first dungeon and your first sword.\n\nWait until you obtain your first sword before you save.  If something happens that prevents you from obtaining the first sword, select \"Retry\" from the Continue menu and try again.\n\nMake sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.  Also note the consequences of pushing a block in a certain direction; a push the wrong way could block you from reaching the passageway.\nNote: It should be impossible to completely seal yourself in such a way that forces you to reset.\n\nAlways make sure you have found every requisite item from each dungeon.  You often need an item in one dungeon to either enter or complete a future dungeon.\n\nVisit Info booths for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items, namely Sword upgrades, and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.",

Ganon found the Sonic Kingdom and decided to stay there as he thought that Link would never find him but as he split the Triforce once again, 4 pieces landed on the Hyrule Kingdom and 4 pieces landed on the Sonic Kingdom.

ZCRealm was the only site to get this quest for a while, as I did not feel as if its style was suited for the general ZC audience. However, if you follow ElectrometerPrime's LPs, you may have seen video of this quest.\n\nHowever, with the passing of ZCR (Well, it'll be gone when 2012 hits, anyway), I figured I'd submit the quest here - while it's certainly not on the level of A Link to the Shadows, I find it worthwhile enough to at least spread around.\n\nKeep in mind, however, this quest is not insanely polished or very big - I did create it in a mere three hours, after all! Either way, hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it! It's three dungeons (and one mini-dungeon) long, and contains a cave system and a small overworld. Make sure you explore places thoroughly to find everything. It may be a bit easy, as you become quite powerful quite quickly in this quest.\n\n(Sadly, this quest has no tracker package to go along with it - I simply lacked the time to fit such music to the quest, let alone very atmospheric music period.)",

It's a spiritual sequel to the first I Hate Mayonnaise, although it really doesn't share much in common with that quest beyond the tileset and overall atmosphere. It's far longer and there's way more to do.\n\nThere are 5 dungeons and many more minidungeons. It probably won't take you too long to beat -- roughly 6-7 hours on the first playthrough, and that's if you bother to retrieve everything.\n\nThis was originally intended to be a sister quest to Exate's Pessimistic Pizza, hence the title, and they were meant to come out around the same time. However, due to delays in both quests development, that plan didn't work out.\n\nThis quest was mostly designed in 2.10, so it mostly sticks to that version's features. There's not much in terms of scripts or new mechanics in this quest. I mostly just focused on design. And the pretty colors.\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nLast updated: 02/16/2016.

Not only is this a very fast way to accumulate money (which you will need) and keep your health high, but many things are hidden in the grass.\n\n• When you get the whistle, the warp ring takes you to: The potion shop, the wand shop, the southwestern most screen in Canyonero, and the entrance to Shiptown Township. You can take advantage of this to quickly get potions late in the game.\n\n• For your reference, large crystals must have magic directed towards them in order to cause a reaction. Smaller gems embedded in blocks require *reflected* magic (ie. with the mirror shield).\n\n• There's a few NPCs in Shiptown Township that offer useful advice, and you can purchase the blue ring and other things there (also, the raft, a required item, is only obtainable there). The entrance to there is in the southernmost section of Festivity Fields.\n\n• There are five heart containers scattered around the world in addition to the four you get from boss fights. You may also retrieve three higher level swords beyond the Splinter Sword you start off with, and there are large rupee amounts hidden in various caves. Exploration is good, so be sure to look around!\n\n• You can get the Lens of Truth as soon as you get the Red Candle (Sunny B. Light).

This brings you into a more flexible and variable type of game, where it`s not easy to get stuck. Although, if you´re looking for a quest with a big overworld and a story, don´t get disappointed.\n\nThis is also the second version of a quest i made 2 years ago, in which i made several minor and some big changes, besides correcting some mistakes in the last version. Some of these changes include:\n\n-No saving during the game except in the entrances of the dungeons.\n-A chapter of introduction to the story.\n-A remake of one final boss.\n-New secrets spread across the exterior of the castle.\n-Use of big bombs in the game.\n\nZC Version of the file: 2.50 RC2",
    "story": "Link is resting in his house in the woods, when he is suddenly awaken by a shouting. When he goes out to check what it is he finds an injured soldier, that before dying entrusts link into the mission of saving Hyrule Castle and rescuing princess Zelda. But before going to the castle, he must find the 4 triforce pieces that the soldier achieved to hide before Ganondorf´s soldiers trapped him…\n\nThe rest of the story you will it find out while you play the quest.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Try to complete the four dungeons simultaneously, for they are of increasing difficulty. In each one you´ll find 3 items and 4 keys to complete them. \nIf you get stuck, you´re probably missing a bombable wall or a raft path in the dungeon. Try to also find the secrets, like the maps and compasses.",

It was designed to bear resemblance to the design of 1st quest; that being an open ended world and not much holding you back from doing levels out of order. (Make no mistake though, unless you really try, you aren't breaking sequence.)\n\nThis quest isn't meant for beginners or inexperienced players.

I also fixed tons of bugs, enhancements, and whatnot.\n\n1.2.5 Update (5/30/12): I added a little more screen improvements and a new custom boss, but I think I'll call it quits for the foreseeable future, and work on new projects rather than touching up this one.\n\n1.2.6.2 Update (7/14/12): When I said I was calling it quits, I meant I wouldn't re-do the overworlds and all that. I will continue to fix bugs (as I did for this update), though. Oh, and I replaced the Light World palette/music with those of the now-removed 'Light World Alt' DMap.\n\n1.2.7 Update (10/16/12): Fixed a lot more bugs.\n\n1.2.7.1 Update (10/31/12): Made the clues for one of my most confusing puzzles more obvious.",

    "description": "This is probably my most script intensive project to have reached completion as of yet. Originally planned to be a joke quest with some minor scripted add-ons it evolved into something much, much more. This quest contains:5 dungeons7 scripted custom bossesLots of bullets4 endings\nNew Scripted Items:Cure Tome - Heals you for 3 hearts and costs 16 rupeesPickaxe - Destroys some small rocksAuto Fairy - Restores your life to full if it drops below 1 heartAttack Multiplier - Causes your magic beam to deal double damageUltra Bomb - Deals massive damage to enemies and destroys all enemy weapons onscreenGoddess Band - Gives the player boosted defense and when used at full health can execute powerful magical attacks\n[UPDATE 6/25/13] After looking back on this quest I realized how buggy it was and decided to do a quick bugfix update. Somewhere along the line I forgot that I was doing a simple bugfix and added a ton of new features. Since this was one of my earlier ventures into scripting, I didn't want to modify the old code...actually I was just lazy. As a result, all of the new stuff was scripted without the use of modern resources like ghost.zh and any lag issues may not be fixed entirely. I tried to clean out some of the old code, but I could only tolerate so much.\nFeatures new to this update:A brand new goofy bonus dungeon filled with brand new enemies and brand new desperation attacksA brand new goofy bonus bossA brand new ending that's just as goofy as the bonus dungeon and bossA new power for an old itemBoss names on health barsA new custom subscreenVarious bugfixes and tweaks\n\n[UPDATE 7/16/19] Apparently despite this being quite an old quest, people are still playing it for some reason. After watching one too many streams of people suffering to some of the more questionable decisions, I finally decided to make the easy and obvious fixes. Took me long enough.The quest tells you about the mouse control element at the start. You're also no longer dumped in a room full of enemies.The Zora boss has been nerfed to be doable without aimed shot.Goddess Band is now on the fast item cycle, preventing some obnoxious inventory stuff in the bonus dungeon. It looks a little strange but it's functionally better.Demon hearts should now disappear after getting Goddess Band.All red bubbles have been removed and replaced with temporary ones.Boss refights no longer respawn.A few very minor layout changes in dungeons to make some stuff less confusing and avoid some time wastes.Mirror wizzrobes die in one hit and one of them has been removed. Cause nobody likes those.",

As she is approaching the center of the forest, she discovers a mysterious temple partially submerged in the forest floor. Seeing what appears to be Link's shadow dart inside, she decides to investigate. As she descends into the depths below, the stairs behind her crumble, leaving her alone in the dark with only her wits and her magic to defend herself with...",

    "description": "After finishing my latest classic quest remixes, I thought I was finished with the Classic Overworld. While I remain most devoted to the Classic tileset, I was intent on creating a wholy new quest, as a Classic Overworld can only be used so many times.\n\nIt was when I realized that many, if not most, Classic Overworld quests (with varying tilesets) were of a single layer that I realized that one can still add depth to a Classic Overworld quest with one tweak: multiple layers. In this case, I took the original, Classic Overworld, restuctured it with my version of a Classic graphics pack (namely palette, tiles, and combos), and added multiple layers to create taller trees, larger boulders, fences for bridges, microblocks in dungeons, etc. I hope with this quest, one can see the potential of any good tileset, so long as one uses layering to add depth to an otherwise single layer map.\n\nCompared to my previous two quests based off of the Original Classic Overworld, the difficulty should be manageable to most people.\n\nAs usual, I played this quest myself thoroughly and am certain everything should be working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can. Also, I will continue to aesthetically update this quest as new tiles become available.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n(Update 7/18/12): Filled in an empty cave Artistic discovered; improved aesthetics, primarily of grassy, wooded areas.\n\n(Update 7/29/12): Lowered the rupee amount of some \"Secret Money\" rooms to reduce chance of overflow; added and improved more aesthetics, most notably the addition of stone walkways (as seen on screenshot 10).\n\n(Update 8/13/12): Removed enemies from an in-dungeon shop (No more unruly \"customers\"!); further minor aesthetic improvements.\n\n(MAJOR UPDATE 2/5/13): After three months of work, First Quest Layered is now formatted for version 2.50. While the general structure of this quest has remained the same, the items and enemies have changed. True Arrows are used (with Arrow ammunition and counter), and both quiver and bomb bag upgrades are available. While most of the enemies maintain most or all of their previous traits and behaviors, some have been totally revamped. Plus, new enemies not present in the previous update have been added.\n\nEven if you have played this quest before in its 2.10 version, I highly recommend that you give this new version a try. Make sure you have Zelda Classic 2.50 to run it through. I hope you enjoy it as much as the older version.\n\n(Update 5/20/13): Minor improvement of aesthetics.\n\n(Update 7/17/13): Addition of new enemies, most notably the Stalchild and the Helmasaur. Look out for the former in the Graveyard. Also, Gels, Chuchus, and Zols act like the new Gibdos, using Eat (Damage) touch effects, but still require one hit to split or kill.\n\n(Update 12/24/13): Overhaul of dungeon wall aesthetics, slight changes to some dungeon rooms to involve more item use.",
    "story": "The Triforce of Courage has been split into eight fragments, each hidden away in different underground labyrinths of Hyrule and guarded by formidable creatures. Only a Hero courageous, wise, and strong enough can reclaim the eight fragments and reassemble the Triforce of Courage to prove oneself worthy to challenge Ganon, the King of Thieves, who has been wreaking havoc upon the once prosperous Hyrule. Are you the one?",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Make sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.\n\nThe five loose Heart Containers (i.e. those not dropped by slain dungeon bosses) have been split into twenty Heart Pieces. Most are scattered and hidden throughout the overworld, but be on the lookout for a few hidden in dungeons as well.\n\nVisit Info booths around the Overworld and Old Men in dungeons for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.\n\nWhile this is not as difficult as my previous two quests, the end can still be a challenge. Unless you have impeccable memory, I suggest players to write down notes, sketches, etc. when exploring the later dungeons. You do not want to forget where one-way shutters are located!\n\nVersion 2.50:\nRemember that, unlike in the original Legend of Zelda, your Arrows are limited, so conserve them for enemies that require Arrows for defeat (e.g. Gohma, Ganon). Enemies weak to Arrows, such as Tektites, and enemies that fire Arrows, namely Moblins, drop Arrows when defeated. There are Quiver upgrades in addition to Bomb Bag upgrades hidden throughout dungeons.\n\nWhile most of the enemies are the same as before, others have been changed dramatically. Four notable examples are the Lynel, the Gel, the Zol, the Gibdo, and the Pols Voice. New enemies, such as the Helmasaur, are also present.\n-Lynels no longer pause to shoot fire blasts and will charge at you upon sight.\n-Gels, Chuchus, and Zols all cling onto you to feed off of your vitality, but still require one hit to split or kill.\n-Gibdos can now grab onto you and drain your vitality until destroyed.\n-Pols Voice are no longer very weak to arrows but can be instantly killed with something else; however, the Ocarina (Whistle) is not effective enough to injure the ears.\n-Being smaller than Darknuts, Helmasaurs have less vitality but are shielded on all sides except its back. If running or sneaking behind it proves too difficult or unreliable, a well placed bomb will work.",

This quest was originally meant to be made for a friend across Youtube, but I think it deserves to be in this database because of how good I think it is.Features involve:- 2 large overworlds- 6 main dungeons- 10 mini-dungeons (very few are optional)- Fun and challenging gameplay- Some clever puzzles- Brand new enemies- Brand new bosses- Enemies have altered HP and Damage.- An interesting plot- Custom dungeon palettes- A bit of humourUPDATE 1:Fixed music in Yold Desert, fixed some push combos to 'Push, Heavy'.UPDATE 2:Since some people found the endless Zubat screech annoying I changed the Zubats to screen ONLY when they die.UPDATE 3:Added a potion shop near the 2 Patra 4's in Level 6 due to people finding it insanely difficult (I feel your pain btw)UPDATE 4:Nerfed Mirrorobes back to their 2.10 damage and HP. Also changed the 10 Mirrorobe room into only 5 instead, and removed the 'Enemies always return' rule. Added MP3s and NSF music and also introduced free-movement.UPDATE 5:Kind of a big update. Nerfed a few enemies and changed some MIDIs around.UPDATE 6:Fixed a bug in the overworld and finally removed the horrific screech from the Zubats. In addition, I also balanced Boss and most enemy HP to reasonable amounts so that they won't drag on forever. And I also made the Patra 4 more manageable.UPDATE 7:Fixed a gamebreaking bug where you can run out of arrows after the fight with Aganhim and then you won't be able to proceed. Also fixed up Level 3 a bit, preventing some very buggy jumps.",

    "description": "One day, I had this crazy idea to make a space-themed fighting game in ZC. So I made one. This game is radically different from most ZC games. Instead of running around, solving dungeons and saving the world, you get to run around, shooting and slashing hordes of enemies into oblivion. The game is divided into levels, which you can revisit from the main hub. All of the game's 16 items can be bought in a centralized shop, where you can find the best selection of equipment for your fighting style.So what are you waiting for?! Download now and start blowing stuff up!Main features:9 unique levels of mayhem!A scripted scoring system to encourage replayability (and practice your mad skills)!4 categories of all-scripted weapons (12 total) to choose from!A working, side-scrolling space level!Ultra-powerful hidden bosses, guarding an additional 4 weapons to collect!And... a jaw-droppingly awesome main characterThis game has an enhanced music file that plays in the last level. For legal reasons, PureZC can't host that file in the quest database. To get it, search for \"megaman x8 jakob download\" to find the MP3, and then put it in the same folder as the .qst file or the ZC executable, and call it \"CIS LVL9 MP3.mp3\". If you don't do this, an ordinary MIDI will play in its place. If you can't or don't want to find it yourself, you can send me a PM and I'll give you a link to the file.11/11/12: Added an opening cutscene that almost explains what's going on, and fixed a few bugs and a typo or two.11/26/12: More semi-important updates.12/12/12: Fixed the enemy respawn bug and un-blocked a door that should not have been blocked.5/31/13: New game-over and level complete animations, less un-hittable Neo-Gohmoid, plus minor tweaks.",

    "tipsAndCheats": "* Use the save point often! The game only autosaves when you get a high score.* You get a bigger cash bonus in each level for higher scores.* You can refill all your life, energy, ammo, and bombs at the panel left of the level selector, and the refill is applied automatically after levels.* You can make the Silencer (DA SPACESHIP) fire faster by hitting the A button really fast, but it also auto-fires when you hold it down.* The included MP3 file must be in the same folder as the game or the same folder as the ZC player.* You can consider the game beaten when you have obtained all 16 items in the shop, found all 6 secret items, collected the reward from boss rush mode (yes, there is a boss rush mode), and earned the intangible reward for beating the game with a perfect score on every level.",

    "description": "This is one of the longest quests I've worked on! I'm still not done making the game! This is the completed first quest!\n\nIn The Light Within you play as the fallen demonlord Sora. Your objective is to find and destroy the 6 Balls of Light in order to unlock the final level of Pencil Tower and defeat your light side! If we consider 1 hour 3 months, or 1 season, you have 4 hours or 1 game year to complete this task on normal mode (My recommended difficulty). Time really doesn't matter, but it adds a fun new challenge to the game. Depending on how hard the game already is, I may or may not change the time limits! My best time is 3:23:36. I haven't speed run this quest because it would involve sequence breaking, LUCK, and skipping many items. Heart containers and pieces are a must in this game if you want to beat it! You can have 20 hearts in total, 4 different defence rings (immortality ring not availible in final dungeon), 3 Roc's feather levels (L1 only in final dungeon), Low and high level dins fire (L1 only in final dungeon), short and long hookshots, 5 different swords including the broken blade, and you can buy up to 6 potions (3 in the beginning) from the potion shop girl, Arukas.\n\nThere will be a 2.0 release later on that will have the 1st quest with extras not availible in this release, and a 2nd quest availible with a similar, yet eerily different overworld, stronger enemies, altered dungeons and altered locations, 3 ruins at old locations, extra story (taking place about a year later), and items and upgrades left unused (or are 2nd quest only)!\n\nUpdate 1: The old version was buggy and I didn't mean to release that version.\n\nUpdate 2: I also fixed the warping to the entrance to the master sword battle from dying in the mirror shield room, The respawn room will warp you back to Arukas's house.\n\nUpdate 3: The Final Gauntlet's block puzzle segment is now easier since you can go to the room before, and the tiles the blocks are supposed to go on are brighter, but you will have to redo the block puzzle from the room you walk back to because the rooms reset and I can't fix that...",
    "story": "WARNING: LONG STORY!\n\nReach Mana (Weapon: Grappling Hook) of the Mountainican Noble lineage is an athlete of the MMRL. Final race of the season he is racing his rival and best friend simply nicknamed \"Jumps\" (Weapon: Springed Boots) for the title of Champion. Near the end of the race they are both teleported to a giant nuclear bomb with a male figure floating in front of them. Reach identifies the person, but hides his knowledge. They destroy the nuke and escape. a few days later the nuke is rebuilt and headed on a crash course for Mountainica. Reach explains to Jumps that the man was Sora (Weapon: Wings), Reach's previous rival who died in a more dangerous VVRL race 2 years ago. Sora is prompt to teleport them on top of the rebuilt nuke, reveal a pair of demon horns, and fight them. After Sora was defeated, he sent them to Hell with him where Reach took his L2 sword (Satan's Bird. A 1 hit banishment on demons). When Sora was banished to the waiting room he used a spell to bring Reach's girlfriend Run (Weapon: Rocket Shoes) and Jumps's girlfriend (Reach's little sister) Itsuki (Weapon: Digging Mitts) to Hell as well. The party of 4 leave to The Hell Motel where we meet Mutoh (Weapon: Hand Shoes), the weird guy who always handstands and is Jumps's equal to Reach and Sora. Afterwards they find a grassland... in Hell? They take it as a blessing and go inside. They rest up and are about to leave when 2 demon girls: Sakura (Weapon: 2 stabbing Knives) equal to Run, and Sue (Weapon: Stilts) equal to Itsuki, cast curses on the land and leave it as barren as the rest of Hell. That in mind, Reach and Co. decide to dig their way into Satan's Castle with Itsuki's Digging Mitts. When they enter Satan's Castle each teammate is picked off 1 by 1 starting with Itsuki and Sue, then Jumps and Mutoh, then Run and Sakura, ending with a battle between Reach and Sora where Reach loses Satan's Bird. Sora is defeated and begs Satan for more power. Satan reluctantly gives him the power and pays for it with his life. Sora becomes the new demonlord and Hell turns into a real sea of flames. Things happen, everyone gets seperated, and Reach wakes up in a bed. He sees Sakura and begins to grab his Grappling hook. Before he attacks her, she reveals to him that she saved his life, she doesn't work for Sora, and she wants to help him in his fight against Sora. She makes a deal with him and becomes his servant for as long as Sora is alive. They find Run first and it leads to a slightly awkward moment. They find Itsuki with a girl named Shiro (Weapon: White Magic) and later another girl named Kuro (Weapon: Black Magic) who have healing arts and destructive arts only matched by each other. Jumps finds the island and leaps over to them. Reach tames a dragon and they go to a hot spring. at the hot spring they meet the girl Test Subject K-3 (Weapon: Mind control, brainwashing, etc.) who joins the party at 8th. They head towards Sora's Castle split into three groups and lead an offensive to take control of the outer land. Sakura teams with Shiro and Kuro, Test Subject K-3 teams with Run and Itsuki, and Jumps and Reach drop right at the front door with Mutoh waiting for them. After Mutoh is defeated, a robot zombie monster clone of Sora falls out of the sky and fights too. Sakura gets in a fight with Sue and has her demon horns ripped off. Healing items depleted, Reach calls Sakura's team and asks for them to return to the front entrance. Itsuki finds the back entrance and her team clears out the first floor. The team reunited continues towards Sora, but not before Sakura gives Reach her L1 Sword (Super finger). Sora reveals His new L3 sword (Satan's Claw) with an odd accuracy killer. They fight, Satan comes back as a Pen being who is far stronger than the Pencil beings of Reach's homeworld, and we find out Sora killed Sakura's older brother Sousuke between the times of Sora's takeover and the party seperation. The fight continues, Sora removes the accuracy killer, and he kills Reach. Reach is alive inside of his own subconcious and meets Hcaer (Weapon: Boomerang) of the Opposite Universe. They merge spirits and Reach is revived with a new sword (Repent finger) that cancels out the power of Satan's Claw. Finally Sora is defeated and drops to the floor, but it's not over yet! 2nd form Sora froze Hell he was so powerful. They defeat him  and are given a sudden death between Reach and Sora. Reach wins and we finally get to the beginning of this quest! Shortly afterward we meet Reach's father Rentetsu (Weapon: Ice picks) who dies of natural causes 15 days after Reach's 24th birthday. This all happened over the course of about 11 months. This quest starts on the 9th month.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Tip: Many small trees are bombable! If you get spin attack (and I suggest you do!) use it to find if a small tree is bombable.\n\nTip: There are many spiked roads! There are 2 ways to manage the spiked roads: Roc's feather and normal boots. I use the Roc's feather because it's a required item! There is only 1 place to find the Roc's Feather!\n\nTip: Abay is an annoyance, but he does give you awesome things!\n\nWARNING:SPOILERS\n\nMini-Walkthrough: First you'll want to get your L1 Sword. Head east until you can't head anymore east and go south then west and you'll find Pencil Tower. Inside Pencil Tower you'll be avoiding enemies and finding keys for your first visit. When you get to the first boss your sword will be right in front of you. Grab it and kill the aquamentus quickly, a heart container is in the room beyond it. After you complete the first visit you'll need bombs. The cave to get bombs is southwest of Pencil Tower on the beach. In The Crescent Moon Cave You'll avoid spiked floors and be killing a custom mid-boss known as a grabber twice. Once you get the bombs head back to the room you got the heart container in and bomb the left wall. Kill the goriyas for the map and go left. kill the darknut and get the key behind the blocks. Open the locked door and kill the wallmasters. Go right, kill the stalfos, and grab the key. Go north, kill more stalfos, and grab the boss key. DON'T go through the locked door! If you do you'll be cursed to have the L1.5 Sword (Broken blade. fires sword beams as long as you have atleast 1 full heart) until you get the magic key. Instead go to the menu, exit game, continue, and head back to the wallmaster room. go north and kill the moldorms. go left and go south. Kill the 2 aquamentus' and get the heart container. Enter the portal and kill the moldorm army for the L2 Sword. Buy your arrow from the shopkeep in town. Head east and follow the tall grass path until you reach the Pen Cave. Avoid spikes, kill enemies, and get the bow before you fight Optomon (Played as a ghoma) who will give you the silver arrow. Take the portal to fight a manhandla and get a heart container. The next portal takes you to a 12 headed gleeok which is nearly unkillable as you are. Leave and go southtoward the beach. You might want to buy the boots that keep you from getting hurt by spikes (I don't because it's not required) The Rentetsu Shrine is along the beach and on a spiked road. Run through the road (if you didn't get the boots you'll need atleast 1 potion) and enter the shrine. Now get the 1st ball of light on your own! Boss: Manhandla.",

    "description": "Quest made in ZC 2.5.Here are facts about this quest, wich you should read before playing!!- This quest is only about fighting enemies, so if thats not for you, go away ;D- You can choose between German and English.- At the beginning you can choose one out of seven characters.- Those are Hero, Druid, Mage, Blocker, Berserc, Warlock, Ninja and theres one secret character you dont know.- Press the MAP button to return to the character selection menu!!! <- Good to know- There 6 levels and a final level.- If you loose all your HP (hearts), you die. Then you have to restart the level.- EVERY character has a sword and a magic wand. The magic wand uses MP (mana points).- EVERY character can slash.- EVERY character also has a chance to land a critical hit, wich is only for the sword attacks not the magical attacks.- No diagonal movement, this time!!- You can save whenever you want. And you should, if you take a break from the quest. When you finish the quest with one character you get a medal for that character. When you have all medals, you have finished the quest 100%!The Zip file also contains the important character table, where you can see the stats of all characters, like MP, HP, Magical Power, Sword Power, Movement, and more.The characters:-Hero- Difficulty: EasyThis is the character from the screenshot . As you can see he has lots of HP but is lacking MP and magical power. His strenght is close combat, as he can deal great damage with his sword.-Druid- Diffictulty: NormalA very balanced character, although his sword attacks are not the best. His great advantage lies in its special ability \"Natural Regeneration\", wich slowly increases his HP, permanently.-Mage- Difficulty: NormalWhile his sword attacks are really weak, his magical power is incredible! This character's strenght is ranged combat, using his magic wand he can beat all his enemies. His ability \"Recovery of Spirit\" slowly refills his MP, permanently.-Blocker- Difficulty: NormalThis mysterious character has lots of power, his sword attacks are almost as strong as the Hero's sword attacks. His magical attacks however, don't do any damage! Instead they block the enemie's movement for a short amount of time (he stuns enemies). Also, he is one of the few characters who have a shield.-Berserc- Difficulty: NormalAnother very balanced character, with a great ability. You can press L to turn on the \"Berserc-Mode\", and R to turn it off. In Berserc-Mode, your sword deals doubled damage!!, but you will instantly die if you get hit in this mode, so it's a great risk. You have to think about when you use it, and when you don't.-Warlock- Difficulty: HardThe HP and MP of the Warlock are pretty low. However, the Warlock has a helpful special ability, the \"Heart-Mana Transfer\". By pressing L or R, he can use this ability to turn 1 MP into 1 HP to heal himself, or to sacrifice 1 HP to get 1 MP at will, so he can do more magical attacks.-Ninja- Difficulty: HardThis character can run faster than all others! It is easy for him, to dodge all dangers. He also has a high chance of landing a critical hit with his sword, even though the damage bonus is not very high.UPDATE: Fixed all remaining known bugs.",

I can't promise it's the best thing ever, but I will say that a year of hard work and a lot of heart went into its making.Features:- Explore a big overworld with tons of secrets in the style of the original Zelda- Challenge 9 dungeons and 4 mini-dungeons inspired by Zelda series classics- Experience non-linear game play and beat dungeons in many different orders- Battle many familiar enemies spanning most of the Zelda series- Accessible difficulty with plenty of ways to challenge yourself- Unique puzzles and environments created completely without scriptingUpdate - 6/1/2016-Removed slow walk combos for underwater areas.-Saving inside dungeons now starts you inside the dungeons on load.-Removed all but one door repair.-Made some adjustments to a few boss rooms to try to put a unique spin on some of the Zelda 1 bosses.-Changed a few unfair enemy and room layouts. (No more red bubble + Lv2 Gibdos).-Removed 1-way shutter traps that were impossible to deduce from visited areas on the map.-Fixed level 3's mixed up palette.-Provided better clues for a couple of obscure secrets (including the path to level eight).-Fixed numerous tile errors and other small aesthetic issues.",

    "tipsAndCheats": "- If the dungeons start to get frustrating, try taking a break to search the overworld for powerups.- As in the original Zelda, dungeons can be completed out of order, but some require items from earlier levels. It should be clear when you're missing something you need.-The later levels have many hidden bomb and walk-through walls. The lens is available on the overworld after getting a bomb upgrade, so if this bothers you, find it as soon as possible.",

In case you are wondering, it is a completely original quest, I've chosen that name because the storyline involves Link travelling to the past, and also obviously as a nod to the great SNES LttP game, but it is not a remake or anything, it is a completely new quest.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 30 different dungeons\n- 20-30 hours of gameplay\n- Every single dungeon is guarded by a custom boss, and there are also a few sub-bosses thrown in for good measure, so I hope you enjoy fighting bosses as much as I do\n- Many optional secrets to find\n- The quest takes influences from several Zelda games but the biggest influence is still Zelda 1, so if you're a Zelda 1 hater, this is probably not for you\n\nv1.79: latest adjustments and fixes",

    "description": "LQftH2 Version Lunaria.0\n\nI decided to update the quest again in response to Lunaria's rather lengthy review and address most of her complaints. In the process I ended up having a little fun and overhauling a significant portion of the quest, adding a ton of new stuff. The dungeon graphics and layouts are still the same, but there's a ton of new content added. In this update you can expect to see:New Dungeons: One of the first things I set out to do was replacing the less well received bonus dungeons with more fair ones. Moosh's Ways, Veni Vidi Vici, and Ultimate Test are still in the quest, but have been moved over to a different game setting called Legacy Mode. The same goes for Level 7 Hard Mode. On top of that, there's a completely new bonus dungeon.New Bosses: Most of the boss related stuff in this update is small tweaks to old bosses, but there's a couple new ones thrown into the mix.New Enemies: Some old dungeons have new enemies in them and some old enemies are returning with scripted tricks up their sleeves.Weapons to Surpass Metal Gear: New to this update are seven tier 5 swords. Seven. Tier 5. They're crazy. Each is based on a Zelda Classic let's player or streamer. If you're a returning player eager to see the new content, you can even use a cheat to start the game with a powered down version of one of them. And there's a few new passive items to collect on the side.A Whole New World: A new fantastic point of view! No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming...Ahem, sorry. The overworld in the original version of the quest was complete skippable trash, almost anything would be better. So I took some inspiration from NewJourneysFire's TRIFORCE which apparently took inspiration from me, and redesigned the entire overworld. I also added some caves and a small town to expand on the world's lore a bit. I think this is my best overworld so far.Difficulty Modes: To make the quest more accessible to different types of players, I've added different difficulty levels that change enemy damage. You can change difficulty at any time, but the game will keep track of the lowest you've played on.Fedora Hunt: There are a few megasecrets (items that do not show up on the subscreen) and easter eggs hidden around. See what you can find...\nI hope this update will be an enjoyable experience for new players and returning players alike.\n\nUpdate 3/22/2016: Fixed a few bugs and made some tweaks to some of the LP weapons.\nUpdate 4/25/2016: Addressed the common complaint about overhead layers obscuring enemies and tweaked the bonus boss some more.",

But things are not a they seem and a familiar foe is working from the shadows...",
    "tipsAndCheats": "As with Link's Quest for the Hookshot, you can always leave the dungeons and come back with more stuff you got with the dungeon items if you run into trouble.

    "description": "Two and a half years in the making, the sequel to Light of the Heavens DX is here! The Darkness Within is a large, story driven game, loaded with features, such as:\n\n-2 unique characters, each with their own playstyle.\n-Nearly every area from the first game is explorable, albeit they've changed a bit...\n-8 main levels\n-Fully scripted bosses (save for one)\n-Lots of scripted items\n-An intense story with three different endings\n-And more!",
    "story": "Two years have passed since Link and Rose struck down Dracus and saved the people of Palm Island. Their time since then has been spent traveling the seas, searching for somebody near and dear to Rose. Following a new lead, they return to Palm Island, expecting a fun reunion with friends. What they find instead are ruins, human remains, and an old foe, Lucis, driven to the brink of insanity.\n\nTo their relief, they soon find that most of the inhabitants of the island escaped safely. But their savior is none other than Dracus, the foe they thought they struck down two years ago. Claiming to have reformed, Dracus strikes a deal with them: they must team up in order to defeat the now-insane Lucis. With no other option, Link and Rose accept.\n\nSo many questions gnaw on their minds though. What's going on? Has Lucis really gone insane, or is something else more sinister at work here? Why did Dracus help all the people of Palm Island? And more importantly, has he really reformed? Can they really trust him?\n\nYou'll have to answer that last question yourself.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "-Exploring your surroundings will always help you out.\n-The first level has two heart halves hidden somewhere; each level after that has one.\n-Potions can be helpful; they'll fully restore your health four times. You start out with one freebie at the beginning of the game, and you're also given a freebie just before the final boss.\n-The ending system is based off three moral choices you make, so if the game seems to be hinting that something's important and gives you a choice, think carefully about what to do.\n-Remember to backtrack to old areas once you have new items; you might find rewards that were previously inaccessible.\n-DON'T quit in the middle of cutscenes. Nothing good comes out of it, and it might get you stuck.\n-The password to the quest is given out at the end, so you can go nuts with the quest if you want. Fair warning through: Excessive cheating will probably break the quest.",
    "credits": "First off, I want to thank three specific people, as this quest wouldn't be possible without them.\nMoosh was an unbelievable huge help. He scripted a good chunk of the game's items, taught me how to script the bosses, helped design one of the levels, beta tested, and constantly provided me with feedback. He also sprited the final boss. This game would have looked much different, and much worse, were it not for him.\nEvan20000 was also a huge help. He frequently gave me advice and feedback, and really helped with the difficulty balancing. His own quest was also a big inspiration to me at parts.\nFinally, SpacemanDan has helped me debug more scripts for this thing than I care to remember. He's also given me tons of genera advice and encouragement, and if that weren't enough, he's sprited a few things for the game too.\n\nNow, for credits in general:\nGraphics: Radien, for the DoR tileset. Peteo and DFW, for the Lost Isle tileset. SpacemanDan, for multiple sprites. Lightwulf, for misc sprites. Jupiter, for lots of trees. Linkus, for dungeon tiles. Scootaloo, for the Link tiles. Mariomario, for the Dracus sprites. Moosh, for the final boss sprites. Orin XD, for misc character sprites. Revfan9, for the horizon background. From the Spriter's Resource: Faty McGee, Smithygon, Robbydude, CrimsonPenguin, Mr. C, and Bean\nMusic: Alestance, Bjorn_Lynne, Espilan, Joan-Michele, Jormungand, Strato, Zagro, the contributors to the Original Midi Pack who were unnamed, and VGMusic submitters whose names I've unfortunately lost.\nSpecial mention for Alestance, who, in addition to writing a few songs, gave lots of suggestions, and compiled the Original Midi Pack that I frequently used.\nSFX: Helpthewretched, Jurassic Park.\nScripts/scripting help: Moosh, SpacemanDan, Saffith, SurrealCanine, and Joe123.\nBeta Testing: Moosh, Evan20000, SurrealCanine, and my own best friend who prefers to go unnamed.\nPost game bug finding: Special callout for Aevin, who's been a big help with those few bugs that slipped by.\nNone of this would have been possible without Nintendo, so they obviously get credit.\nAnd finally, you, for the taking the time to read this all and play the game.\n\nIf you deserve a place in the credits and I forgot to credit you, PLEASE let me know ASAP so I can give you proper credit",

    "description": "After finishing my latest classic quest remixes, I thought I was finished with the Classic Overworld. While I remain most devoted to the Classic tileset, I was intent on creating a wholy new quest, as a Classic Overworld can only be used so many times.\n\nIt was when I realized that many, if not most, Classic Overworld quests (with varying tilesets) were of a single layer that I realized that one can still add depth to a Classic Overworld quest with one tweak: multiple layers. In this case, I took the original, Classic Overworld, restuctured it with my version of a Classic graphics pack (namely palette, tiles, and combos), and added multiple layers to create taller trees, larger boulders, fences for bridges, microblocks in dungeons, etc. I hope with this quest, one can see the potential of any good tileset, so long as one uses layering to add depth to an otherwise single layer map.\n\nAfter the mostly positive feedback from First Quest Layered, I realized that a sequel was needed, so I crafted this quest with the same basic Overworld with small changes in topography and different locations of dungeons, items, and other secrets. This quest is slightly more difficult than its predecessor, particularly in puzzle solving.\n\nAs usual, I played this quest myself thoroughly and am certain everything should be working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can. Also, I will continue to aesthetically update this quest as new tiles become available.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n(Update 5/20/13): Fixed/improved various aesthetics:\n-Overworld, 4B: missing Layer 1 combos\n-Overworld, 5E: removed unnecessary Secret Combo Flags from Tall Grass edges made obsolete by \"Tall Grass –> Next\" Combos\n-Level 1, 52: removed unnecessary Secret Combo Flags from doorway\n-White Sword Palace, 13: turned on lights in block puzzle room to conserve player's Magic meter upon retrials\n-Level 8: restructured Side Warps transitioning from flooded to non-flooded areas\n-Level 8, 51: replaced \"Burn (Any)\" flag with \"Burn (Wand Fire)\" flag to necessitate acquisition of Magic Book\n\n(Update 5/23/13):\n-Shop 0: (closest one to starting point is one screen northwest) sells Large Magic Jars for 25 Rupees instead of Life Potions to allow for easier Magic refills\n-Overworld, screen 22: changed Shop to Potion Shop, now requires Mushroom (Letter) for commerce\n-Overworld, screen 50: benign Moblin now offers advice instead of free Rupees\n-Level 4, 02: teleport tile returns player just in front of the south doorway of the room, resets block puzzle to prevent player trapping oneself\n-Level 6, 42-52: middle doorway is now open, while right doorway is locked to allow access to block maze, require acquisition of another key, and avoid preventing player from completing dungeon\n\n(Update 12/24/13):\n-Overhaul of dungeon wall aesthetics.\n-Added a missing Map and Compass in Level 5.",
    "story": "The Triforce of Wisdom has been split into eight fragments, each hidden away in different underground labyrinths of Hyrule and guarded by formidable creatures. Only a Hero courageous, wise, and strong enough can reclaim the eight fragments and reassemble the Triforce of Courage to prove oneself worthy to challenge Ganon, the King of Thieves, who has been wreaking havoc upon the once prosperous Hyrule. Are you the one?",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Make sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.\n\nObtaining Sword upgrades is no longer a simple matter of locating swordsmiths; they have to be earned by exploring Sword Palaces, one for the White Sword and another for the Magic Sword. The minimum Heart Container requirements still apply (five for White, twelve for Magic), but each Sword Palace boss drops a full Heart Container when slain.\n\nSeven loose Heart Containers (i.e. those not dropped by slain dungeon bosses) have been split into twenty eight Heart Pieces. Most are scattered and hidden throughout the Overworld, but be on the lookout for a few hidden in dungeons as well.\n\nThis quest enforces the use of a Magic meter, which begins at four blocks. There are four extra Magic Containers hidden in either the Overworld or in one of the dungeons.\n\nVisit Info booths around the Overworld and Old Men in dungeons for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.\n\nThe final few dungeons can be a challenge. Unless you have impeccable memory, I suggest players to write down notes, sketches, etc. when exploring the later dungeons. You do not want to forget where one-way shutters are located!\n\nWhile most of the enemies are the same as before, others have been changed dramatically. Three notable examples are the Lynel, the Gibdo, and the Pols Voice:\n-Lynels no longer pause to shoot fire blasts and now charge at you when standing in its line of sight.\n-Gibdos can now grab onto you and drain your vitality until destroyed.\n-Pols Voice are no longer very weak to arrows but can be instantly killed with something else; however, the Ocarina (Whistle) is not effective enough to injure the ears.",

Also fixed a misplaced trigger in Level 2.UPDATE 5: Removed the 'Enemies Always Return' rule seeing the amount of people who hated it.UPDATE 6: Made the final Mirror Amy more easier so that it won't be a nuisance to go through. Also replaced all MP3s with MIDIs.UPDATE 7: Made the minor Mirror Amy battles a lot easier.UPDATE 8: Final update until any further notice. Fixed plenty of bugs and changed around difficulty again.UPDATE 9: Added a few money-dropping enemies in the final boss (more specifically Mecha Shadow's phase) to prevent any mess ups.UPDATE 10: Made the Desert of Doubt far easier to navigate due to its horrific trial and error gimmicks. I also fixed the shieldless sprites of Blue Darknuts.UPDATE 11: Fairly minor update, but changed the graphics of every Moon Gate (portals) in the quest so that they no longer look badly sprited.UPDATE 12: Fixed up some cutscene errors at the final fight and you can now see yourself more clearly on the dungeon map.UPDATE 13: Fixed even more bugs with the final fight (thanks to Cukeman for pointing these out)",
    "story": "Sonic and his team where flying on their spaceship looking for distant lands and worlds far away from Mobius.

With added power, Robotnik claims to take over both Hyrule and Mobius at the same time by getting the 'Light Force' or Triforce to add on even more to his new power. Amy gets aggrevated and claims she'll get the full Triforce before Robotnik does. Robotnik then makes a challenge for Amy which is to collect all 8 pieces of Triforce when her abilites and items are removed, in other words, she must start from scratch. She sets out on a long journey through Hyrule to collect the pieces of Triforce and save Hyrule from being overrun by Robotnik.(Full, detailed and more humorous story in the intro of the quest)",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- When you get the Lens, be sure to use it quite often if you find yourself stuck, they will reveal secrets to you.\n- Be sure to visit the Temple of Armour and the Temple of Swords after Levels 2, 5 and 8 to get upgrades.\n- Come back to the Take 'Em All On challenge after Level 1 to get a Heart Piece and Levels 5 and 7 to get scrolls for the sword.\n- When coming across block puzzles, ALWAYS plan ahead before going straight into solving them, there's a huge possiblility that you may screw up.\n- If you find a dungeon too difficult, use Potions to help or search for Heart Pieces in the overworld to get you stronger.\n- If you're going for a 100% run, remember to go back to older caves that you couldn't progress before, you are most likely to find either 50 force gems or a Heart Piece.\nThere is currently a video walkthrough on this quest, use it if you're completely stuck: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=ZzyxlyBnHBA",

Although Quest of Darkness was the first quest I started making, it is now my second completed quest.This quest is a tad bit more linear and a lot less involved than Myst Island. If you've played Myst Island before, you would be able to tell that this was my first attempt at making a quest. It's definitely more straight forward.It has two overworlds, (however, I did not use up all the DMap space) and 9 dungeons.",

    "description": "WARNING\nQuest contains suggestive text strings and \"jokes\" that may not be appropriate for a younger audience. Some things in the quest could even potentially be construed as stereotypical or bigoted, albeit on a very mild scale. Most probably won't agree with that notion, but I advise against playing this if you are easily offended.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThis is the sibling quest to Rambly's I Hate Mayonnaise 2: Depressive Donuts, and the \"sequel\" to Ibuprofen. We wanted to release both quests in the same period, but due largely to motivational issues on my end, that didn't happen.\n\nDesign on this quest began during the end of November '09, when I had the motivation to do another \"joke\"-esque quest. I originally intended to release this quest during Christmas of the same year, but the work I was putting in didn't allow for such a quick release.\n\nThe bulk of the quest was finished within the next year or two, but I wanted to add a bunch of secrets to the quest. A large, extra dungeon kept the game in development limbo for the next couple of years, as I couldn't bring myself to work on it very much. My preference for a lot of the things in the quest changed over time, but I couldn't motivate myself to work on those, either. I did, however, manage to transition this quest from 1.92 to 2.50. It still plays like a 1.92 quest, but has the added convenience of arrow ammunition, and a revised subscreen.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the quest wasn't going to have all the other things I wanted to add, so I decided to tie up the loose ends, and release it as-is. My original goal was to be more satisfied with this than its prequel, and I managed to accomplish that long ago.\n\n\nAbout the Quest\nIf you've played Ibuprofen, then you already kind of know what to expect. The quest still has an overall very simplistic design to it, and it progresses almost exactly the same as the last quest. There's just a lot more creativity in this one.\n\nThe dungeons in this quest are something of a novelty display. They aren't very complex, either.\n\nAs the sibling quest to IHM2, this quest shares a couple of perks: You start with farore's wind, and there's a \"death tree\".\n\nThe difficulty may be considered average by most. The final dungeon is harder than the bulk of the game.\nOn this note, some enemies (aquamentus, gleeok, and ganon) were buffed. Death knights were nerfed; they move no faster than Link, do less damage, and stop moving before firing. Mirrorobes were also nerfed; they do less damage.\n\nThe quest also features custom SFX. Lots. Its the primary culprit of the file size.\n\nThe quest name, like its predecessor, is irrelevant to the actual game. It has personal significance to me, but nothing more.",
    "story": "The \"story\" is essentially no different than its prequel:\"The Ghost of Christmas Future kidnaps Zelda and takes Link's Lon Lon Milk. Link's pretty mad.\"",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Each and every dungeon has a secret room that contains an optional item. There are no blatant hints on-screen as how to obtain these, but that's not an issue if you keep this in mind: The secret rooms in conjunction with the displayed map make the dungeon shape symmetrical (with the exception of two dungeons). All of these items are completely optional, but they can make the game easier if acquired ASAP. As for the exceptions... Level 2 has two rooms, and they are situated somewhere at the upper section of the dungeon. The item dungeon, however... that's up to you!If a concealed entrance on the overworld looks a bit too simple to uncover, you probably shouldn't go inside.There are a total of 16 hearts in this quest; you have the primary 12 as with the last quest, and 4 very well-hidden ones.Every B-button item slot can be filled. The blue candle is the only item that does not appear.The lens of truth drains magic instead of rupees (as was the case with Ibuprofen). Din's fire also consumes magic.All equipment slots can be filled. Obtainable equipment includes: Wooden/white/magic/master swords, ladder, flippers, magic meter, blue/red/gold rings, magic/mirror shields, power bracelets, amulet, boots, and din's fire. You begin with 500 rupees, farore's wind, the quiver, and the \"letter\". The wealth medal and the raft are also obtainable, but are well-hidden.The level 1 cheat is hidden in the quest. I will not disclose what it is, or where it is located.And for those whom didn't know already, if the quest author has enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot rule, the magic boomerang blocks magic, and the fire boomerang reflects it. To tell if this rule is enabled, items will be \"pulled\" back to you when they make contact with the boomerang or hookshot. If they're instantly acquired, the rule is off. The rule is enabled in this quest. Please don't forget it!",

Fixed some graphical errors (barring pallette issues, but I didn't understand sprite palettes when I made this, and I don't want to fix it... The bosses will look bad, so just kill them in mercy.)

Stalfos do only 1/2 Heart (2 HP) of damage (in line with their damage), but the swords still require the Magic Shield to block.3. Red Lynel Swords now only do 1 Heart (4 HP) of damage (in line with the BS-Zelda fix)4. Death Knights have been nerfed: Their swords now do 40 damage, in line with their contact damage5. Mirrorrobes have been nerfed back to their 1.92 B 183 level, only taking 3 shots to kill (hopefully). Whomever powered them up IDK why.6. Boss effects put in (New Quest was so early in ZC Development this feature was overlooked)7. Gleeoks are now hurt by wand magic, putting them in line with the manual saying they're hurt by both sword AND wand.8. First room of Blue Goriyas taken down to 3 of them.New Bosses:1. Level 1 - Digdogger - 25 HP, does 1 heart of damage instead of 2.2. Level 4 - Gohma - 25 HP, does more damage. He's an old crab now. ;-)3. Level 5 - Gleeok - bumped from 3 heads to 4 heads4. Level 7 - Gleeok - bumped from 4 heads to 10 heads5. Level 8 - Patra - No longer 3 Patras, but one Big Circle one with more HP (50) for the center and double HP (24) for the eyes. It also shoots fireballs now. It's also different color to differentiate itself from the Lv. 6 Patra and the normal enemy Patras.6. Level 11 - Gleeok - Now has 40 heads legitimately7. Level 11 - Fire Gleeok - Now has a ton more HP and only 4 heads, a real boss fight now. This might be buffed for more HP pending playtesting.UPDATE: Version 4.0.  This is the final version.  I fixed the Digdogger issue and the Game Icon problem, as well as making this more stable.  This is \"as is\" from this point on, unless something's extremely gamebreaking, this is as stable as I can make it for future builds.  If you want the most stable version for all future builds, please play the Rebuilt version.A restart is required for 4.0.",

An archeologist, in search of an ancient civilization that most scholars agreed was nothing more than legend. He was either determined or insane, depending on who you asked.\n\nHe was an ass, though, if you asked Elliot Devar. The archeologist's teenage son didn't have much respect at all for his father. The man was two-faced. Kind and enthusiastic in front of a camera, but mean, almost abusive, when in private. Elliot found his father's field of work fascinating, but resented being dragged around from place to place and being forced to do all the hard work. \"Go through this small tunnel, Elliot.\" \"Carry my tools for me, Elliot.\" \"Don't you dare sass off to me or I will make your life miserable, Elliot.\"\n\nMean as his father might be though, Elliot never had any reason to suspect he was any more than an egotistical jerk. Until one day, when his father sent him crawling through yet another muddy tunnel in a cave to scout ahead. On the other side though, Elliot found something quite different than normal. A hallway, lined with crumbling pillars, ending in a sealed door. And a glove, and a voice beckoning him to pick up the glove...\n\nElliot's life collapsed in that moment, as the glove spoke, explaining things Elliot didn't want to hear. His father was searching for something, something called the Vault of Souls. And if he were to find and open it, it would mean catastrophe. Elliot is forced into a search to locate the three key shards to seal the vault before Dr Devar can reach it, in a quest that could ultimately pit father against son in a showdown that, despite how they might act on the outside, neither of them want to happen.\n\nThe Vault of Souls is discovered. Hurry, Elliot...",

Enemies get progressively difficult as the game goes on, so you gotta make sure you stay ahead of them- Electricity is strong against water which is strong against fire which is strong against electricity.

It is not possible to save, because this is pong and there's nothing to save  \n \nControls for the Left player / the Blue paddle:\nEx1 for left. (press to grab item in item grab mode)\nEx2 for down. (hold to move the paddle down)\nEx3 for up. (hold to move the paddle up)\nEx4 for right.

In this mode, the ball changes it's color depending on wich player hit it the last time. The color of the ball then decides who gets the item when the ball touches it. The white ball destroys items, it does not collect them. In this mode it is more based on luck who gets items.\nGrab Item mode is playing with items that randomly appear on the stage. In this mode however, items must be grabbed by the players in order to collect them. To grab an item, you must press the grab button while you're in line with an item. Items that are grabbed by a player can't be grabbed by the other one, so whoever's reaction is faster grabs the item.

    "story": "\"Pong (marketed as PONG) is one of the earliest arcade video games; it is a tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat the opponent in a simulated table tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari Incorporated (Atari), who released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Dabney decided to manufacture the game.\" - Wikipedia",

This is also useful for getting an even higher score..or unlocking Bonus Boss Attacks.

Use this to your advantage. EX: A blue laser will deal 1 damage to a blue target, whereas a red laser will deal 2 damage to a blue target.\n\nAbsorb shots! Projectiles of the same polarity (color) can be absorbed by your energy shield, (floating or fixed) and will increase your current stored energy. Green bullets cannot be absorbed by your shield, however you can deflect them by using the sword. Yellow and Grey bullets cannot be stopped.\n\nScoring System: Basically like Ikaruga. See that little number with the three dots in the upper-left hand corner of the screen? Yep, that's the one. Kill a blue enemy and it turns blue. Kill another one and you've made two. One more and congrats, you've just completed a chain! So now it should read \"1\" and be grayed in. Now kill three more enemies of a certain color and bam! Two-chain. I think you get the idea. Currently there is an on-screen display limit of 99 chains. Anything past that point will read \"max\". Maybe there are secrets that unlock if you get enough?\n\nSuicide bullets Sometimes spamming laser shots is the worst thing you can do! Beware.",

    "description": "ANOTHER IMPORTANT UPDATE: A wonderful player named pixcalibur alerted me to a couple of breaking bugs in the game. These (hopefully) have been fixed. The stairs to the lower levels of 5 and 6 now work correctly, as does the Red MP bottle.\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE: I've looked at all the feedback and made some serious improvements. First and foremost: the overworld map is now enabled. I've replaced all the classic music with new tunes composed by Spawn. There is now a three-stair warp that you can access after the third dungeon to help you get around, as well as a bunch of little changes and bug fixes, especially in Level 9. Many thanks to everyone on the thread who helped with their feedback and letting me know about what was and wasn't working.\n\nIt’s a classic style quest with a few twists. There are lots of items to find, experience to gain, plenty of caves to explore, eight dungeons, each with a piece of the triforce and a basement full of magic and powerful equipment, and an underworld with mini-dungeons and the impregnable fortress of Ganon, captor of the princess Zelda. Get the gear, kill the bad guys, save the girl.\n\nNew things to find and do …\nMany of the weapons and items from the various Legend of Zelda games are here, along with a host of new ones. There are now maps for the overworld and underworld to point you to the dungeons. In addition to your regular bow and arrows, there are a double- and triple-shot crossbow that are a bit slower, but much more powerful, a whip that can stun in front of and behind Link, and seven magic spells—each with two levels of power:\n\nA Drop of Life (red) – A cheap way to heal a bit between stops at the fairy’s pond\nDragon’s Breath (orange) – Burn your way past your enemies with firey breath\nEnhancer (yellow) – Give your sword a boost to cut through your opposition\nStunner (green) – Need a moment to think? Stop your enemies in their tracks\nZelda’s Faith (blue) – Protect yourself against the strongest of foes\nAbei’s Gift (purple) – Are your wallet, quiver, and bomb bag a little too empty?\nLink’s Wrath (grey) – Crushing damage, and in it’s most powerful form, a vital boost too!\n\nNo matter how you take down your enemies, they each provide a little experience. As you rack up the levels, your maximum HP and MP will go up too, as well as your ability to carry supplies.\nWithin each dungeon, the dungeon boss holds the item you’ll need to access both the basement and the next dungeon. The items you’ll find in the basement aren’t necessary to complete the quest, but they’ll make things much easier.\n\nA note on magic …\nMagic plays a big part in this quest. While you only start with a little bit of MP and a single spell, in time you’ll become a powerful wizard in addition to a dominant fighter. When you cast a spell, a little time has to pass before you can cast another. A bar will appear beneath your MP counter that will let you know when you’re ready to cast again. As you build levels and find upgrades, you will be able to cast spells much more rapidly.",

Authenticity can bite me, I feel like this will make the quest a bit more approachable.\n-Moved the location of the Cross.\n-Added in new music, as opposed to the usual Z1 tunes.\n-White Sword sprite returned to its original state to avoid confusion.\n-Removed/filled in some caves that were empty. (hopefully all of them, I think I got all of them.)\n-Added in the missing Heart Container and moved another to a location that I feel is less annoyingly obscure.\n-Level 1's map and compass changed locations.\n-Put a shop with bombs near Level 1. This is probably the most important thing I've done.\n-Both changed and added some advice on the Overworld.\n\n--Update-- (January 18, 2014)\n\n-Fixed a bug where an important staircase wouldn't appear on the overworld.\n-Fixed some doors in Level 7 that made it impossible to complete otherwise.",

Highlights include:-Moldorm Prime health reduced from 48 to 36, but bombs are slightly less effective.-Bonus boss summons Death Knights much less frequently and should never summon twice in a row.-Medusa summons bubble enemies instead of hugbos.-New secret boss added on Normal and Hero difficulties. Drops an item comparible to the prize for the current bonus boss.-New secret boss is a complete sidegrade from the current bonus boss; the conditions for the quest's ultimate prize can be met by beating this boss on Hero Mode.This is my first quest, but it features:- Adjustable difficulty settings- Large gameboy-like overworld- Sprawling, complex dungeons- New challenging boss fights- Headscratching puzzles- Sidequests- Estimated 25+ hours of gameplay",

Before each dungeon you can get at least one additional heart if you look hard enough. This quest's difficulty is significantly migitated if you keep yourself healthy.\n- Try using all of your items. If you try and treat this quest's combat like a lot of other quests (Sword+Boomerang everything, etc...), you're going to be in for a rude awakening. Many of the items have been rebalanced or given new functionality to make them more useful.\n- If you're having difficulty on a puzzle, try looking at it from a different angle.\n\nIf you're still stuck, just head over to the help thread here.",

    "description": "UPDATE 7-28-15:\nThis is a major update to my first quest.  It was made in the summer of 2013, released in 2014, and now updated in 2015.  Even though there will be a DX version of this (Which will be very different from this quest and have an entirely different structure), I wanted to make this quest live up to the potential I once saw in it.  While this update was mostly numerous bugfixes, I decided to replace most of the things that were truly bad and replace them with something much better. Here is the list of things that were updated in this version:\n- Replaced the Blue Tunic dungeon with a new minigame (You still get the Blue Tunic from it)\n- Replaced the entirety of the final boss into something much shorter and enjoyable.\n- Took out the 4-refill potions (including the free ones) and inserted regular potions to balance difficulty.\n- Took out the Level 3 sword in order to balance the difficulty better, but replaced it with another useful item.\n- Completely changed the 7th floor of the Music Tower into something shorter and less repetitive.\n- Nerfed the Red Tunic in order to balance the difficulty.\n- Added a bonus dungeon that gives out some rewards and a special secret for 100% the game.\n- Changed some common Midi's into more unique Midi's.\n- Added an NPC that travels around, gives trivia, and provide hints on puzzles.\n- Edited the bosses of L3 so that it's easier to fight them and that they don't do mandatory damage.\n- Tweaked the boss of L2.\n- Numerous, numerous bugfixes.\n\nQUEST DETAILS:\nLost Identity consists of one overworld, four dungeons, a few minidungeons, a bonus dungeon (recently added), and 6-8 hours of gameplay.  This quest focuses a whole lot more on gameplay than on story, so please keep that in mind.  I hope you enjoy!",

If you break a rule, you'll just die in the game and you'll also be told which rule you broke. Make sure to not break the rules. As new rules come into play, the quest slowly gets more and more challenging.\n\nMany of the rules make for some awkward, weird or funny situations, which you need to treat as an extra challenge to the quest. If you still find this really easy to beat, there is a really difficult endgame bonus dungeon, just for you. You will also get a notification and a 100% mark in your subscreen when you have completed the quest and collected everything there is to find. Nothing is permanently missable, you can get every item even after beating the final boss and seeing the credits.\n\nUpdate:\nFinally, a long awaited(?) update is out, fixing the biggest issues, so I can be happy with this quest.\n\n- The worst rules have been replaced with better ones.\n- Now featuring controlled randomness, to give you rules based on a difficulty rotation.\n- Added options at the beginning. You can now play without rules, or with more frequent rules or start with all rules active!\n- Extra minutes are changed to give you 2 minutes, but are placed more carefully.\n- Improved final boss.\n- And minor changes here and there.",

This is the best tip I can give you, as there are items like the boomerang that are easily missable. Also, speak with everyone. People might have some good tips for you, or some useful items to sell.However, don't waste time. New rules are steadily coming and coming, and if you let them all be added, it will soon get frustrating and too much for you to handle. So, just keep this in mind while playing ",

There are 4 items available:\n\nBoomerang: You can stun your enemies. This item is for people, who aren't good at fighting.\nArrows: You can kill your enemies from afar. This item isn't as strong as the sword though (you have infinite arrows)\nBombs: You can blast your enemies away. This item is really strong and helpful (you have infinite bombs)\nPotion: You can heal yourself. This item can be used 10 times!\n\nThe levels:\nEvery level is different. One level has 10 waves of monsters. There are 8 levels:\n\nKurasia Field: A peaceful level without any hazards. It's the perfect place to get used to the game!\nScary Graveyard: This is a spooky level where ghosts are flying over. Don't touch them!\nDungeon Arena: In this dungeon there are spikes. Enemies can walk there, but you shouldn't!\nUnderwater: The wayward ocean current can be very annoying. It moves you in all directions!\nBattle Rock: A level where you fight fast enemies. You also need to dodge the falling rocks!\nOn-Off Mansion: In this creepy mansion the light goes on and off. And you'll need to fight hard enemies!\nLava Canyon: This canyon full of lava is the most dangerous level. The lava is really hot!\nMonster Rush: You'll rush through all the previous levels and fight every monster again!\n\nThere is also a final boss and a bonus level.\n\nA problem with this quest and also with Fight the Monsters II: It can get repetitive pretty quickly.\n\nUpdate: I fixed a bug in the cutscenes inbetween levels.

    "description": "Hero's Story is the first quest I have ever completed. I decided to do a Z1-style classic quest because more complex projects were too..well complex for me  I hope all the bugs are fixed. At least the game-breaking ones. The zip includeds two quest files: the normal mode and Hero Mode. In Hero Mode, you take extra damage from enemies and never get any heart or fairy drops; only way to restore health is by visiting a Fairy Fountain or using Potions. Anyways, enjoy, have fun, rate and give me feedback!  Also, can you find and beat the Bonus Dungeon?? ",
    "story": "Three years have passed since the land of Hyrule was saved by a boy named Link. Hyrule was in peace. But one day Ganon returned and took the Triforces and Zelda. Zelda divided the Triforce and hid the pieces in a faraway land called Worldia. Ganon also went to Worldia. Link must gather the pieces and save Zelda.",

    "description": "Eiyuu has a unique story with a cast of brand-new characters and will mainly serve as an experiment in game play, storytelling, and new items. The theme of the quest is explore.\n\nMade for and play tested in 2.50. Playing in other versions may result in undesired consequences. (One was found in 2.50.1, in fact, so play in the recommended version, please.)\n\nRating difficulty on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (insane), play testers gave Eiyuu around a 5. With the latest update in place, this rating should hold true for more players. Later areas can still be tricky though.\n\nEiyuu contains 4 to 6 main levels (it's...weird to explain) and a number of secrets that will probably be classified as \"too many.\" There is also an experimental karma system that will keep track of items the player may have taken illegitimately from others. The karma system no longer affects any ending. Boss battles are not this game's strong suit but there are a few good ones courtesy of Moosh.\n\nThere is a small side legend revolving around 5 \"mega-tier\" secrets you can find in the game. Some of the higher-end secrets become increasingly abstract, but all solutions are intended to be logical and have in-game hints. I expect the player to think during these challenges.\n\nUPDATE (7-11-2014): Sorry for the extremely early update, but I apparently closed off a path I didn't mean to in Level 3 some time in the past. Both keys should be obtainable in either order again like in the demo build.\n\nUPDATE (7-21-2014): The next major update that fixes quite a few things. Page 14 on the thread describes them. A couple people helped me test and save files shouldn't break. (I only bring this up because I changed something in the Global.)\n\nUPDATE (8-12-2014): Another major package of stuff, noted in Page 19 of the Eiyuu thread.\n\nUPDATE (1-4-2015): Another damage control package of updates, including a couple somewhat new things. Noted in Page 25 of the Eiyuu thread.",
    "story": "Zelos Phoenix is an explorer searching for a particular rare item. With a guide at his side, he hopes to track down the item in the mountainous region of Myso. But as Zelos travels, he ends up caught in the middle of a race for the item.\n\nThere are four endings to the main story. One ending (the canon one) CAN be missed and whether you miss this ending depends on what you complete before finishing Level 2. Even if you miss it, you can still get \"a\" good ending that is similar to the canon ending.\n\nSome scenes and dialogue can change depending on the items you have or the actions you have (or maybe haven't) performed. The story ultimately goes to the same place, but details can be altered or added depending on what the player has seen.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- If you cheat and break something, you get what you deserve. Play the quest as intended and ask for help if needed.\n- MONEY IS LIMITED for a good while. Enemies usually do not drop Rupees and you have no sword to slash bushes. Invest wisely.\n- READ the story or TALK to NPCs if you get lost in quests easily. You are always told where to go next or are given a general idea on where to look.\n- The karma system can make the game easier or more difficult depending on your play style. Be mindful of the items you decide to take as not all of them are possible to get in a single playthrough.\n- Check earlier areas as you progress through story events and levels because more will open.",

New dungeons, new items, and some changes to the game flow. But items are still shuffled, and you have lots of ground to cover.Compared to the previous versions, the big new feature of this version is how the Light and Dark overworlds work. Now you must seek out portals to travel between both, and dungeons now appear only in one of the two overworlds.There are now bonus dungeons to seek out, for those who thought they knew everything from the previous versions. The standard item total is at 200, but you can go for 103% if you wish.Update 1.1: Now you can use a seed to randomize the quest. A seed is a 16 digit number that will produce the same item placement when used... assuming you also use the same custom randomizer options. Great for sharing your item layout with others!",

It will come in handy, and can be found at a discount in a certain shop.1.1 Feature: If you use a seed, you might start with an unexpected item.Version 1.11 fixes certain weapons messing with important animations",

Tons of excellent changes, special thanks to Lunaria for the stream and all the suggestions!\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t\nGeneral Changes:\n• Enhanced music was added to almost all areas of the game.\n• The Reversion Rondo functions better now and should not allow you to warp onto a solid tile anymore.\n• There is less input delay when using the Timeshift Serenade (location warp song).\n• You are now able to grab items with your sword.\n• You are no longer damaged by your own candle fire.\n• Aurelia now generally talks less at help giving tablets.\n• Almost all block puzzles have directional indicators.\n• The blue tunic is no longer a prize in Dungeon of Trials #2 and can be attained earlier.\n• The mini map indicator of Link's position is now a different color, regardless of tunic held.\n• A key counter was added to the passive subscreen.\n• Bat enemies are now much less common.\n• Bypassing the trial required by using the Reversion Rondo for Nayru's Love has been fixed.\n• A super bomb shop was added in the Gly'cov Overworld.\n• You can no longer sequence break into level 7.

NOTE: Music no longer comes with the quest. See the quest forum to download the music.\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t\nFlow Remasted Final Update\n\n\nOverworld/Combat/Quality of Life Changes:\n\n- You now slide faster on ice.\n- A cave system shortcut from the main overworld to the wastelands has been added. You can access this passageway after obtaining the slingshot.\n- A portal shortcut from the main overworld to the Lon Lon Ranch has been added. This can be accessed after obtaining the candle.\n- A shortcut to Gly'cov Mountain has been added. This is avaiable as soon as you get the flippers. In fact, it was there before, but it required the hammer. Now, it just requires the flippers.\n- In a cave system on the way to level 2, a room full of portals has been adjusted.\n- All present Stalfos now die instantly to fire just like their past counterparts.\n- It is no longer possible to obtain the Upgraded Wand without the Aspected Wand.\n\n\nDungeon Changes:\n\nLEVEL 1:\nRecieved a lot of changes. In its original design, it recieved a lot of criticism for the swamp caverns close it being part of the dungeon.\nWhile I liked the idea of the dungeon being built into the entire swamp, I decided to scrap that idea for dungeon completion. The dungeon still is connected\nto the swamp caverns, but it is NOT required for completion.\n\nChange list:\n- New color pallette\n- New music\n- You no longer have to leave the dungeon to complete it. As such, the way to complete it has changed.\n- Now contains an Heart Container Piece.\n- Most traps have been removed from level 1.\n\nLEVEL 2:\nThis dungeon was redone in the last patch, so almost nothing changed. This change, even though small, will reduce the only bit of backtracking that I believed annoying for a completionist.\n\nChange list:\n- One of the Heart Container Pieces in level 2 has been removed.This was the HCP that required blowing up a wall on the lowest floor of the dungeon.\n\n\nLEVEL 3:\nAfter the shortcut added in the last patch, level 3 was in a good spot. However, feedback yielded that the mini-boss was too difficult in his 2nd and 3rd iterations so adjustments were made.\n\nChange list:\n- Outside of the dungeon, a switch was added to lower the barrier to the dungeon.\n- The 2nd and 3rd iteration of the mini boss now deals slightly less damage and has had their respective hp reduced by 1/3.\n- The 3rd iteration of the mini boss now takes full damage from the sword.\n\nLEVEL 4:\nI always believed level 4 to be an excellent puzzle dungeon. The only aspect that deemed annoying, was the occasional dark rooms due to having to swap items so much.\n\nChange list:\n- Level 4 no longer contains any dark rooms.\n\nLEVEL 5:\nThis was always one my favorite dungeons, but for some reason, it was always one of the most hated. The dungeon had 4 entraces all over Gly'cov that you would complete in phases.\nWith the following changes though, the dungeon will now only have 2 entrances where the main entrance is the only one that is important. You will have no reason to exit the dungeon once you enter it now\nand if you do, it will be to buy potions which is now conveniently placed outside of the second entrance. With the change to level 1 and 5, now the only dungeon you have reason to leave is\nLevel 2, which makes sense due to its easy and convenient location.\n\nChange list:\n- New music\n- The dungeon no longer has multiple entrances. It just has two, but you complete the whole dungeon by going in the one main entrance.\n- The areas that you used to have to travel to now contain optional prizes.\n\nLEVEL 6:\nThis has, and will always be, been my favorite dungeon in the game. Not only is it full of puzzles, it has a high level of challenge. As such, I did not feel it warranted any real changes.\n\nChange list:\n- The music in Level 6 has changed.\n\nLEVEL 7:\nThis level is designed for you to be aware of your surroundings, but primarily as a battle oriented dungeon. With the change to ice, the dungeon feels smoother in addition to me deciding that\nI strongly dislike dark rooms. As such, this dungeon will see those removed.\n\nChange list:\n- All dark rooms have been removed from Level 7.\n- The music for level 7 has changed.\n\nLEVEL 8:\nThis dungeon is unique and serves as a great test of your battle ability before entering level 9. I did not feel it warranted any changes, but felt the original music was slightly unfitting.\n\nChange list:\n- The music for level 8 has changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Flow of Time (Remastered) is a fully upgraded and re-envisioning of my original quest, the Legend of Zelda: Flow of Time. The remake hopes to bring forth exciting gameplay and puzzles that are reminiscent of the Gameboy Zelda games, in particular, the Oracle of Seasons & Ages. It is my hope that even those who played the original, this will provide a truly new and unique gaming experience. Thanks the tremendous power of ZC 2.5 versus 2.10, there are so many additions to the game, such as:\nUnique Dungeon Masters for every dungeon.SidequestsScripts to make the game feel more like a Zelda gameand much more!\nIn addition, my graphical ability has improved substantially, which will make the beautiful world of Gly'cov come alive. Here is a comparison of what the game looked like before, and what it looks like now:\n\n\n\n",
    "story": "In Hyrule, the sacred Triforce governs the land. Time and time again, many have sought its power. The sages have sealed away the Triforce in the remote land of Gly'cov and when an evil magician in Hyrule heard of this news, he traveled to Gly'cov. When Mythelkr learned that the sages had actually sealed the Triforce in the past, he captured a descendant of the sages, the oracle of time, Aurelia, and used her power to lay waste to Gly'cov and use her power to find the Triforce.Briefly managing to break the bonds of Mythelkr's spell, Aurelia sends out a prayer... will anyone answer her call?",

    "description": "This quest was once a mere place to test how my ripped Catlevania tiles would look with LoZ sprites and stuff, nothing more. But then, I stumbled upon BlueKnight`s script showcase videos on YouTube and amazed what ZC scripts can do! An interesting but non-promising idea was sparked in my mind: What if I put Link into Castlevania, complete with sidescrolling. Back in the time when I wasn`t good at scripting, I have posted a quite ambitious script request: Castlevania-syled staircases. Chances of fulfilling that wish were really slim...And after a pair of weeks I got a response from a guy nicknamed Grayswandir. He posted a giant piece code that, judging by comments, looks like a custom sideview engine. With stars mechanic. After installing it into the quest, I got a almost working staircases! Almost because there were a lot of bugs and glitches that limit creativity with new engine. After a couple of iterations, testing and bug-fixing, the engine was brought to at least usable state. And then Grayswandir disappeared without trace, leaving me with a half finished quest.I have opened quest project page to search for new scripters to help me on my way. Of course, posted a few screenshots and a 4-stage demo. ZoriaRPG had tried to help me with scripting. But everything turns out to be either horribly buggy or done in wierd ways. The only good thing he did was a flashing effect for Rosario item pickup. By the time Zoria left the project, all 8 planned stages were almost finished design wise. At least entire quest was playable from start to ending, even tough a lot of stuff was missing. With the lack of contibutors on scripting side the project was put on hiatus for long time.But I have found a topic made by BobbyLight. It has a Zscript coding IDE plugin for a text editor called Rtext. And then a guy nicknamed Kurt91 posted a work-in-progress script: Beginneer`s custom boss kit. While testing it for glitches, I have accidentally opened the script file in Zscript editor and it was nicely formatted and commented. It sparks my incentive to start learning scripting. After reading Saffith`s scripting tutorials several times I started to practice in scripting, starting from wierd things, like a wand that throws giant boulders. And discovered that extending Lweapon`s sprite is a good basis for whip. After writting and compiling script, I found out it`s just good enough to be in the quest. This sparked a new \"life\" for my quest.The \"golden age\" of scripting has begun. I have done a lot of work in terms os scripting (stdCombos.zh, stdWeapons.zh, candelabra script and lots of other work). When I posted screenshots featuring some of my Castlevania subweapons (notably Axe and Holy Water), Zoria was amazed on how fast I have learned scripting. This gained me more than enough motivation to lift the project off hiatus and install all my related scriptwork. Also I have reverse-enginnered Grayswandir`s sideview engine (this was easy, thanks for comments) and fixed pretty much all it`s bugs. The learning of ghost.zh allowed me to script CV enemies completely from scratch, while discovery of the fact, that changing of npc->OriginalTile on the fly does wonders, allowed me to simplify enemy animation routines.The rest was a pice of cake: odds and ends, bug-fixing, beta test and then release.",
    "story": "An ungodly mysterious event has caused Link to be warped into demonic dimension, to the place where it`s very dark and scary. After looking around Link sees a giant slhouette of enormous castle-like structure shined by larger than usual moon. Turns out, it`s an infamous Dracula`s Castle! The only viable way to escape the demon realm is to explore the castle in and out and finally find out who is responsible for this trouble.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "1. EX1 to jump. R to read stone tablets on background for clues.2. Pretty much all major treasures are hidden in breakable blocks. Use whip or sword to break them.3. Use warp whistle to warp to previously beaten stages to search for missed stuff.4. Be careful when breaking candles in stages 4+. Some of them contain nasty traps. Pay attention to candle flame animation.5. Health pickups are rare.6. CV weapons are good against CV enemies and Zelda weapons are effective vs Zelda enemies./!\\ Watch out for bloody effects.",

    "description": "- The whole idea behind this quest is that I'm tired of mountains being the main obstacle to reaching other areas. Why not make water the main obstacle and hide the flippers in a later level? So, Link starts out on one island and will explore many islands throughout this quest. Oh yeah, one clue I'll give you is that the raft is in the 1st dungeon, not a later dungeon, because you need it to visit all the other islands.\n- For this quest, I've created my own graphical style by enhancing the Classic graphics, using over twice as many colors, and including some needed Link-to-the-Past-style graphics (which I greatly added to, BTW) to make what I call the Modified Classic tileset, though not a released tileset (yet).\n- Since this is technically a Classic-style quest, I tried to use as many of the NES room types as possible. Don't be surprised to find a secret door that ends up being a door repair! (Don't be scared to look for secrets, though; I kept \"door repair\" types to a minimum. For example, the first island has plenty of secrets on it and none of them are nasty, I promise you.)\n- This quest is being made using ZC version 2.10 for a couple of reasons: because that's how it began, and also because I wanted to learn ZC's full capabilities before learning scripting or having all the bells and whistles that came with version 2.5 (even though I have dabbled in 2.5 a bit since I started this quest).\n- This quest uses 2 overworld maps, and, just to give you an early hint, I made the outside edges of the maps scroll-warp to the opposite side! (Of course, you'll need the flippers before you can find this out in-game.) This is to give the effect that (most) sailors lose their way and can't find their way home after arriving. (But of course Link should make it back to Hyrule after he finds Zelda. At least, I'm sure they'll find a way...)\n- That being said, though, there are more than 2 \"overworld\" type maps. You'll see what I mean after you beat level 8.\n- There are at least 9 dungeons, but many surprises to be found, to include a number of side-dungeons and caves in which Link will find useful items.\n- If you're an explorer-type of game player, then this is definitely the quest for you!\n- ***By the way, BE FOREWARNED: My Intro is LONG due to an extensive back-story. I apologize for this up front, but I'm a storyteller, so that's how it worked out.  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE EXTENSIVE BACK-STORY, SKIP THE INTRO.*** (Just thought I'd tell you up front in case you're the type to jump right into the action.)\n\n--- UPDATE --- (10/15/2014)\nIncluded in this update:\n- New midi for level 3 (same song, different version), courtesy of EddyTheOliveira\n- A few bugfixes regarding combo placement, layers, and continue/spawn squares (blue/green squares)\n- Redesigned a problem screen in level 6\n- Fixed a missing burn flag on Serpento Island (for a secret)\nUpdated info on this database entry:\n- Added tip about bombs in dungeon rooms (added as #4;

    "story": "(Watch the in-game introduction in the quest to get the whole story. The basic story is this:)\nAfter Zelda 1, Ganon's chief wizzrobe Xanthis began scientific experiments in an attempt to develop a clone of Ganon. In the back-story of Zelda 2, Xanthis is the one who controlled the magician that cast a sleep spell on Zelda. Many years after Link awakened Zelda, Xanthis was able to make a stable clone of Ganon and taught him all that happened to the original Ganon. Fueled with knowledge of the past, the Ganon clone succeeded in kidnapping Zelda.\nBefore Link had time to act, Ganon and his minions boarded a ship and sailed to the far east. Link got help from Captain Mido, the captain of Hyrule's shipping fleet, and pursued. This quest starts right after lightning hits Link's ship and he awakens on the sandy beach of an island.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "1. Invest in the information shops. I only put worthwhile information in them. (Don't pass them up thinking that they'll trick you like in the original Zelda game.) If you're not sure how to proceed or are missing a vital piece of information, chances are you'll find it in a local information shop. Every major island has an information shop, so you won't go clueless if you visit them!\n\n2. Explore, explore, explore! I've hidden many secret areas in this quest. Some places on the overworld, as well as in dungeons, you may be able to return to with later items and get farther.\n\n3. Some things that look solid are not solid. Try pressing against the walls/mountains/trees.\n\n4. ***If a bomb item appears after defeating enemies (in dungeons, mostly, though this applies to a few other areas), that's often a hint that you need to use a bomb in that room, i.e. on one of the walls.***\n\n5. Most dungeons have 2-3 major items to be found.\n6. If you didn't visit some rooms in a dungeon, either you missed a secret passageway, you have to return with a later item, or there could be another entrance...\n\n7. Use the Lens of Truth once you obtain it. I've enabled Lens Hints, so that you can tell exactly what item to use (most of the time) to trigger a secret.\n\n8. Most boss rooms have a secret hidden somewhere in them (for levels 1-7). They are not just boss rooms!",

    "description": "Note: It's not meant for beginner players, actually rather difficult I'd say but made by a beginning Questmaker, it's my first Quest ever.\n\nGraphically it's mostly the Tiles coming with ZC, some BS and the Newfirst for enemies. It only has some N00bish attempts for creating something like weather effects.\n\nThis quest is something between Dungeon Romper and Story-driven. Since I can't script and am not too smart with puzzles it's a bit enemy heavy though it does have some riddles (with weird solutions at times). Thus I at least tried to keep it entertaining with story.\nI have a full grid Overworld, loosely themed with climatic zones and the classic 9 main dungeons.\nAdditionally to that, I have some mini-dungeons for rings and swords and a bonus dungeon, loaded with scary strong enemies and bosses. The bonus dungeon is nearly as big as the Overworld and consist of 9 parts, each with a special item.\nI packed a bunch of wave files in the quest so even with the rather big size, it's more due them, not actual playing content.\n\nLittle Update: Enabled Overworld Map and renamed since it seem to have confused some people. Relocated Farore's Wind to level 1 and reduced Bombchus in it.",
    "story": "Story, well it's part of a bigger story spanning a longer time (I have yet to make) but too big for one quest (especially of a starting Questmaker). In the quest itself it's a pretty standard start. Link turns 15 and dreams of a big adventure, coincidently a mysterious merchant passes by on his birthday and presents him a special item, promising it will grant his wish. Soon he lands lost in Hyrule and just starts adventuring while searching for a mean to get back. He learns of Ganon's invasion and Zelda's adduction while that and goes after Ganon. The rest, well see for yourself. You have a normal, a good and a bad ending, both alternate endings are accessible after seeing the normal one.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "1. Always have potion with you, you even start with one. I also have a 3 times use potion in this quest.2. Each Overworld screen has a secret, sometimes good, other times bad. Find out for yourself.3. After Level 3 or getting the lvl. 3 items to be precise, you can find the lens. This quest was made with extensive lens use but few magic available in mind.4. Look carefully at the beginning, I hint towards the first vital items in the landscape and dialogs. The rest is pretty straight, just go where you weren't before. Later levels are on the way north.5. You have more HC/P than you need, as long as you find them. When you maxed you should avoid any coming because you might need to pay with a lot of blood at some point.6. Your Equipment to be good is very important so look for secrets. I also wouldn't attempt anything beyond part 2 of the bonus dungeon without the best gear available in normal game, even though, most of it can be accessed after getting the latest level items.7. You start/continue with 50% health so better use save points and Farore's Wind, the S-points are usually hidden around main dungeons. This is a F6 penalty and I will keep that, including future quest though I might change the value for other Quests.",

    "description": "It is a typical Zelda style game with basic overworld exploration (ne main overworld and 3 mini overworlds),8 main dungeons, with a final dungeon,several mini dungeon,Max health is 20 hearts with 36 heart pieces scattered around the world.Basic standard ZC items.Minor scripting (Still learning how to make and use them properly).\n\tSpoiler \n\tUPDATE (12/18/17): This update provides more enemy balancing, bug fixes, and various text error that were brought to me attention.  Thanks to Pixcalibur for helping out with these updates.UPDATE (11/16/17): This update provides a lot of cosmetic clean-up of the quest, bug fixes, and other various things that were pointed out to me by Secret French Fry and Deathrider365's LPs.UPDATE (05/01/16): This update pertains to problems and errors that were found in Melee Wizard's play through of the quest. Fixed some of the tiles errors and clean up of the over-world and enemies. Second cleaned up text errors that I probably created fixing other ones. Third the hardest part doing an overhaul on the last boss and making the player have more interaction with him and kind of guide him to the phase you where he is vulnerable. I tried to get this done after SCKnuckles play through and in the last update, but was having some problems with it being to random and still not selecting the path where he would be vulnerable more frequently. We corrected the some of the graphics errors that was not showing up in the final boss fight. \"Even the nasty fire gleelok at the end has been modify to be more fair\". We appreciate the feedback and error notifications to help improve this quest for everyone to play and enjoy.UPDATE (02/01/16): This update pertains to all of the issues that were brought to my attention during SCKnuckles LP of the quest and made some changes to address the frustrating problems with the quest and clean up of the quest in general. Dreaded spelling/grammar errors are always looming but we caught a good amount of them, did a clean up of the enemies and balanced them more to be fair and i will try to lay off the bats next quest. Added some hints and minor rework to the levels to make them less frustrating and removed a lot of dark rooms in the quest but some still will exist (Just the not necessary ones). Did some minor tweaks to the final boss but it is still a work in process and will be releasing an update with his changes at a later date when i can complete him to my liking and past the testing (he is a 2.10 style boss and he is very delicate and breaks easy).UPDATE (11/09/15): Well with more bugs and typos brought to my attention I decided to release an update correcting those. One big problem was the 5th floor of the tower with the hammer switch puzzle causing the player to get stuck, I replaced the puzzle with a more user friendly version of the puzzle, corrected some typos they we missed, and even done some minor nerfs to some of the enemies in the game to balance them a bit more. Thanks to SCKnuckles currently LP of the quest (currently at level 6), it helped us quite a bit to find the more elusive problems/bugs. I was going to release an update after he finished the LP but he broke a puzzle that I had to release an update to correct that problem.UPDATE (08/26/15): A few More Broken Warps were fixed and boy it is hard to find all these after they break especially when they worked before and then stop working. I also fixed a game shop problem where a door is supposed to open after you pay the guy the money and not always be open. Last but not least cleaned up some of the graphics in various places, but nothing major to make a huge impact on the game itself.UPDATE (08/18/15): In my process on adding newer scripts for some unknown reason the warps in level got scrambled and had to redo all of them to point to there proper location and still looking into how this happened since all of the script testing were more of cosmetics and appearances. Everything worked in testing and I was not getting the warp glitches until SofaKing pointed them out in level one. This version has the corrected warps for level one and hope this does not happen again in future levels.UPDATE (08/15/15): This update is more of cosmetic one with addition some more scripts and cleaned up those goofy wizrobe fairy spawners that people mistake as enemies and tried to kill them. I cleaned up some graphical errors that I missed combing through the quest last time and cleaned up some very bad fights and positioning of enemies (this one will never end since the enemies know how to break this every time and there will always be new ones I missed).UPDATE (05/08/15): Fixed a few bugs with some of NPC not talking and ladder issues in level 7 addressed, along with a few other graphics and minor glitches. weakened a few of the normal enemies and bosses reducing heath and damage a bit to make it a bit easier and less annoying to the player. Added a shortcut back to the amulet cave and a hint (to look for items before entering the dungeon) for level 6 to make it more friendlier to the player.UPDATE (04/26/15): Redesigned level 2, and it has a completely new fresh feel to it and much less annoying. Fixed a few discovered typos that escaped our grasp last time. Fixed and made a few graphics edits and minor level modifications but nothing to big to change the scape of the level drastically.UPDATE: (02/01/15): Made all keys level specific to prevent key carry over and possible breaking the game, modified some graphics and level designs a bit, and minor bug fixes.UPDATE: (12/31/14): Fixed GFX/Tile errors in lvl5, and ladder bugs in the over world, modified the drop rate of arrows in arrow mini game increased the drop rate, added additional hints in the game, and made minor changes to the blocks in level 2 to note that you need the gauntlets to push.UPDATE: (10/30/14): Fixed bad warps and GFXs especially the one in level 5 that was noted by Patgarret. Modified other small things made potions cheaper in the quest and minor bug fixes.UPDATE: (10/20/14): Fixed a dead swim warp on the overworld that was discovered by GhostKnight22 and various other small things.\n",

This is also my first full sidescroller quest.\n\nFeatures include:\n- 8 Enemy Masters\n- 4 Ganon Stages\n- 10 different items\n- Features only classic Mega Man songs\n\nOne more thing to mention is that you start with the arrows and the feather; arrows on A and the feather on B. The quest rule \"Can select A-button item on the subscreen\" is enabled in this quest, so in theory you can use two different items at once if you really wanted to. However, I would recommend keeping the feather on A and all the other items on B to make the quest a bit easier, but that's just me.\n\nUPDATE 1: Fixed a few bugs including some ladder issues and completely redone the subscreen so that linear navigation is no longer a problem. Nerfed the boomerang quite a bit to make it no longer like the Metal Blade.",
    "story": "Ganon has invaded Hyrule yet again, and has unleashed his eight enemy masters into the land. Link must go out and destroy the 8 masters to defeat Ganon and save Zelda from Hyrule.... That's about it.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- You can jump and use items at the same time. Be sure to use this as an advantage.\n- Everything, including bosses (except for Ganon), can be killed with just arrows.\n- All items, except for the sword, arrows, potion and feather, use up magic, so be sure to use your items wisely, although magic drops are quite common.\n\nBoss Order (if you want to make the game easier for yourself, here's the boss order in terms of weaknesses)\n\n\tBoss Order \n\tPols Man -> Ghini Man -> Whizz Man -> Like Man -> Goriya Man -> Zol Man -> Moblin Man -> Darknut Man -> Back to Pols Man and repeat\n\n\nGanon Stages Boss Weaknesses\n\n\tGanon Stages Boss Weaknesses \n\tGanon Stage 1 - Blue Gohma - Arrows or Sword\nGanon Stage 2 - Yellow Robe - Arrows or Wand\nGanon Stage 3 - Strengthened Patra - Arrows or Hammer\nGanon Stage 4 - Link Clone - All Items\n\nGanon - Sword and then Arrows for the final blow\n",

Unlike the previous Randomizers, this quest takes place in the BS Zelda overworlds which are a little more linear in design. The same could be said about the BS dungeons, so I also created two more sets of dungeons to add variety.Item collection is tracked, and item completion is a smaller 133. Not including bonus content, but why would there be any of that?Based on the time mechanic of the original games, every so often something special will happen that helps out. Will you get unlimited sword beams? Better rupee collection? Infinite bombs? Take advantage of these bonuses, most are short lived.New to this randomizer (and added as an update to the Super Randomizer) is the ability to use seeds for the randomizer. A seed as a 16 digit number that will reproduce the same results when used... assuming you also enable the same randomizer custom options. This means you can share your specific item arrangement with other players.",

This feature offers replayability and gives players a bit of freedom in how they want to play.\n\nOther features include:\nTwo dungeons that can be done in any order.\n- Several optional secrets to search for.\n- Two endings.\n- 90% of the overworld to explore right from the start.\n\nList of changes from the original 2 week version:\n- The final boss is completely redone.\n- All the bugs that have been found before have been fixed.\n- Very minor enemy edits.\n- New SFXs.\n\nBUGFIXES:\n12-20-14:\nSee page two of the help forum here for the list of fixes.\n11-30-14:\nForgot to change some header settings.",

    "description": "This is a quest that has taken me a little over seven years of on and off work to complete. Since it was started so long ago, this is a 2.10 quest. My goal with this quest was to show off the true capabilities of the 2.10 editor, using features and tricks I had seen only in the best quests, as well as numerous I came up with on my own. I never updated this to a 2.5 quest because I felt it would ruin the magic. No freeform combos, no custom enemies, no scripts; just some good old fashion creative design. (That being said, the quest has been tested to be fully playable in 2.5.)In this quest you climb a large, 10 floor tower. Each floor is its own level, and each floor has its own gimmick. For example, on the first floor, there is uncrossable water and patches of sand. After finding a magic warp, the water freezes and becomes crossable, but the sand becomes impassable rocks. You must switch between these states in order to find your way to the next floor. The floors start off simple: Zelda 1 style dungeons with basic gimmicks, but as you climb, the floors start to become free-form, and the gimmicks become more and more complicated.In fact, reaching the ninth floor of the tower is really only the half way point through the quest. The ninth floor is special in that it is a quest within a quest – it has its own overworld, cave systems, towns, citizens, and eight full main dungeons to complete, alongside a couple side dungeons and mini-games. There are numerous trade quests, a day/night system, custom fights, and the mysteries behind the tower begin to make themselves known. Expect many different areas and atmospheres, and lots of open exploration.Of course, for those looking for a little something extra, there are a number of secret dungeons hidden throughout the tower. Not only do these dungeons net you extra heart containers, but finding and completing all the secret levels unlocks the true ending to the quest, and allows you to unravel the mysteries surrounding the tower.On the whole, this quest is all about dungeon exploration and puzzle solving, and it puts many interesting twists on item uses and area themes. Expect 15-20 hours of gameplay, with a total of somewhere around 25 complete levels to explore.",
    "story": "A young boy who lost his parents in a war years ago decides to go on an adventure. He travels to a fabled mysterious forest, and finds a large tower. Knowing this tower must be filled with tricks, traps, maybe monsters, and perhaps great treasures, he begins racing toward it. However, what he finds is more than he could have expected: powerful, menacing foes, mysterious helpful writings from a Wise Old Man, and prophecies of a certain death should he continue to climb to the top of the tower.As he climbs the tower, he suddenly finds himself in a mysterious land which leads him to question his journey. Who are the people in this land, and how did they get here? What is the purpose of the tower, and how is it linked to this strange land? Who is the Wise Old Man, and what could possibly bring certain death in the tower? And most importantly, will he be able to return to the tower and make it To The Top?",
    "tipsAndCheats": "-The sword is on Floor 6. Don’t worry, you won’t need it until then (arrows are better anyway.)-There is a magic shield on Floor 7. Try not to lose it.-Maps have information about the locations of keys, warps, and special rooms. You'll have to figure out what the markings mean though.-Each of the Lost Halls (secret dungeons) has two heart containers. The first hint to their locations is on Floor 7.-Keep track of what you’ve found and what you’ve done of Floor 9; the quest doesn’t display much of it due to 2.1 limitations.-Draw maps for the later floors. I’m serious about this. Drawing a map for at least Floor 10 will make your life much much easier.",

The overworld has been revamped, dungeons have been completely redone from scratch, the story has been altered, and plenty of new items, enemies, and challenges have been added. It's essentially a completely different game now. So what can you expect from this quest?An exciting story, told via scripted cutscenes that integrate seamlessly with the gameplay.Three main dungeons and two optional dungeons, all of which contain scripted puzzles and gameplay mechanics.New scripted items such as the Magnet Shot, which allow for never-before-seen puzzles and enemies.A lovingly crafted overworld that changes as the quest progresses.Three different endings, depending on what choices you've made and secrets you've found.Completely scripted bosses.And more!Update: February 4, 2015\n\n\tChangelog \n\tLucis's HP has been increased from 100 to 130 after multiple complaints that he went down too quickly.You can no longer scroll off screen during cutscenes in the Tidal Sanctum and Ice Caverns.A warp has been added in the final puzzle room of the Ice Caverns to prevent the player from becoming trapped.Bugs with the boss key puzzle in the Magma Sanctum have been fixed.It is no longer possible to swim off the map on Palm Island.Miscellaneous typos have been fixed.\n",

A mysterious villain offers the inhabitants of the island an ultimatum: Be gone in 24 hours, or be destroyed. Determined to stop the man at any costs, Link teams up with Rose, a young woman with a troubled past, and together the two of them comb the island for anything that might help them survive. Confronted with the ruins of an ancient race, the two of them search for the answers that might save their lives. Who were the Aletians? What became of them? Who is the man threatening the island with death? How is he tied to the island? And perhaps most importantly, is there anything that can stop him? With three different endings and multiple plot twists, Light of the Heavens offers a thrilling story from start to finish.",

Palm Island is home to many secrets, and health and sword upgrades are available to those who seek them out.A strong shield and potions can be purchased in Palm Village.

    "description": "Version 1.2 Release Information:\nThis is a newer version of the quest. It includes the long awaited, and hyped-for-years Hero Mode. Zelda fans can rejoice at last. Hero mode brings along a few new challenges, including:\n\n- Tougher enemies! Most have more HP, and do more damage, or some combination of both.\n- Some items have been replaced, and moved around. You can now find the Blue Ring.\n- The only way to find hearts is in bushes, or pots, Enemies don't drop them anymore unless it's a mini boss!\n- No more fairies, and there's only one potion.\n- New overworld palette (gasp! It's so HD 3D), and new (old, actually) dungeon music.\n- There is no list of items in Hero Mode. Figure it out yourself!\n\n\nVersion 1.1 Release Information\nThis is a one dungeon quest, but not a joke quest.\nWith that out of the way, you can expect a nice 30-40 minute romp through a dungeon of moderate difficulty. It is designed with slightly varying paths with speed-running in mind. I actually made this a long time ago, and had the intention of making a 'full' four dungeon quest, but, well, reasons happened, and I quit working on it . I figured I'd polish it up a bit, and go ahead and make it an official release since people seemed to like the demo I released a few years back, but has probably been lost to the ages.\n\nFeatures:\n- One dungeon. (wow)\n- Four Overworld Screens. (gasp!)\n- A House! (I can't believe it)\n- A few of Link's items. (get out)\n\n\nAdvantages over original release:\n- Has more of a beginning, and end. It's not just a dungeon, that warps to its entrance when you beat it.\n- Fixed a lot of minor bugs, and discrepancies. It plays a lot smoother now. These include issues with the over-under bridges, and mostly things with layering.\n- Balanced certain elements a little better. Shuffled around some items, and added in the magic shield.\n- You can now carry 15 bombs, instead of 8 from the start.\n- Grass in the overworld will ensure you never run out of bombs, or rupees.\n- Both quests are unpassworded. If you want to look around, go for it. Just please be respectful, and don't steal stuff from it. I don't care if you ask to use something though if you want, I'll most likely say yes. There's a lot of extra stuff not seen in the game, like some other stuff I was working on that didn't get finished.\n\nA link to the old thread has been added for those curious. Everything within though is defunct since this release.\nI hope you enjoy this small release from me. Happy New Year! ",

    "description": "A large quest featuring a real ocarina item, gasha seeds and rings, 7 large dungeons and smaller mini-dungeons, fully scripted bosses and minibosses, minigames, scripted items... It comes with an adjustable difficulty setting to adapt to the player's skills.\n\nThe quest includes:\n- 14 different ocarina songs to learn\n- 60 different rings which grant you various powers\n- Many gasha seeds to plant\n\nThe difficulty has four settings: hero, normal, easy and very easy. It is always possible to lower the difficulty in-game (but not increase it) so I recommend you start in normal mode to see how you're doing before you choose a lower difficulty. Hero mode is extremely punishing and is only recommended to players who have beaten the quest in normal mode beforehand.\n\nEstimated gameplay time: around 20 hours. You will be given a \"game completion\" score at the end of the quest.\n\nThe quest was created and tested with ZC 2.50.1 final.",

    "tipsAndCheats": "Ask for hints on the forums if you get stuck.For people who want to use cheats: the quest is script-heavy and by using cheats you will most likely break it. I recommend you instead post a message asking for help, or lower the difficulty setting if needed.",

There are only three pieces of the Triforce, hidden in the 11th, 14th and 17th dungeons.Be warned that if you fail to read signs or talk to NPCs you could seem to get stuck since the location of some items and dungeons is not easy to find on your own.",

    "description": "First off, a disclaimer: this quest is honestly not up to my own standards, but I have been asked many times to release it, so I’ve decided to finally do so. I made it in about a week when 2.5 was officially released in order to acclimate myself to the new editor and learn about new features. Thus you should not expect anything great or very well-polished, but it should still provide a solid experience.This quest features:-One 8x8 overworld, and eight small dungeons.-Somewhat non-standard and non-linear progression: you can do some dungeons in different orders, and the dungeon rewards vary from new items to opening new areas.-Overworld and characters that change as the quest goes on (make sure to revisit characters that tell you to do things; after you’ve done them, they may have, for example, opened a shop.)-Interesting use of the enemy editor; many enemies have an item they are weak to, and boss weaknesses have been twisted to change the classic fights. Some of the later bosses are admittedly fairly tough if you don’t know what to do, so make sure to try all of your tools (super bombs are especially good.)-Lots of pointless counters on the subscreen (damage taken, enemies killed, etc.)-The Black Potion.",
    "story": "Upon returning home after defeating Ganon, Link finds his house has been occupied by Moblins. In fact, the whole country has been overrun! In anger, Link does whatever it takes to get rid of these pesky Moblins, including burning down a forest, robbing a bank, draining a lake, and possibly worse.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "The secrets and dungeon design mentality is fairly classic in nature. This means you should keep the following in mind:-Keys are often hidden behind unmarked bomb walls, in grass/bushes, in stairs that appear from directional push blocks, under bombable cracked tiles, and the like. The dungeons are fairly small, so brute force searching for these secrets should not be too horrible.-Every dungeon is consists of a rectangle of rooms. You can use this to help you narrow down where to search.-The whistle drains water in many places. Try not to forget about this.As mentioned above, enemies generally have weakness. In the case of bosses, it is usually the dungeon item (regardless of what they are conventionally weak to – for example, Manhandlas only take damage from the boomerang in this quest, and different colored Gohmas take damage from different projectiles.)Make sure to go back and visit NPCs after finishing dungeons; they may have new things to say, or better, they may have opened a shop or gambling game.Try to be somewhat stingy with ammo; it can be a bit difficult to come by at times.At the very very end of the quest, you will have to kill some like-likes.",

    "description": "Legend of Lana is, if it wasn't obvious, a quest that got inspired by Hyrule Warriors.\nAfter seeing the NES overworld in that game and the sprites, I got quite inspired, and asked myself: What would it be like if you could play as Lana in Zelda 1?\n\nThis, is what I came up with! It's one of those \"third\" quests, that uses an overworld heavily inspired by Zelda 1, but still features some distinct changes, and most important of all; New dungeons!\n\nWhat to expect:8 Triforce dungeons!A final level with an epic showdown!Gameplay inspired by how Lana functions in Hyrule Warriors!Shitty humour!Puzzles!Bathrobes!Er, I mean, Batrobes!Massive item and Enemy rebalance!Furthermore, Lana gameplay will function very different from how it usually is with Link, since item focus is very different. For example; There is not a single shield in the game, so dodging is more important than ever! Items that usually requires magic don't (wand, candle, etc). Likewise, items such as bombs and arrows have unlimited uses, just as in Hyrule Warriors. Of course, they have been rebalanced to work this way! For example, using bombs as a common weapon is now possible, since you'll never run out of them!\n\nDifficulty level will be around what you'd expect in the second quest, if I were to make an estimate. By PZC standards, that probably means the quest is a bit more on the easy side. The focus of the quest is to provide a challenge for most players, but not be particularly punishing if the player actually goes out of his or her way to find all the side quests/upgrades on the overworld!\n\n\nYour quest to reclaim the triforce of power starts now!\n\n----------------\n\nVersion 2.3 Change log:\n-> The lens of insight now has added graphics to better reflect the on or off state.\n-> There is now a second shop that sells the lens of insight.\n-> Boosted range and projectiles on all three levels of the standard Special.\n-> Special ring recovers special at a faster rate. (Almost twice as fast.)\n-> There is now rather slow passive special generation. (Requires new save file to activate.)\n-> Version number on status screen is now in a less obvious and intrusive colour.\n-> There is now a recommendation to seek out the green tunic when you enter level 4. (It's at this point the game expects you to have it.)\n-> The arrow trigger in the lava area of the overworld was made more obvious as to what it was.\n-> Players are now told how many hearts they need to have in order to acquire the upgrades that require X amount of hearts.\n-> Players are now informed that you can't play money losing making game unless they can pay for the losing fee. (Though, as before, you can still attempt.)\n-> New enemy: Bat (L0): It's basically a regular bat with reduced movement speed and half health.\n-> Level 4's difficulty has been tweaked:\n--> Reduced amount of shooters in rooms that had more than one.\n--> Replaced around half of the Bats in the dungeon with Bat (L0)\n--> Misc small changes and bug fixes in regards to enemy placements.\n-> Manhandla 1's base movement speed (all heads alive) was reduced slightly.\n-> The room where you can get a free lens of insight now forces you to walk into it and closes until you clear the encounter.\n-> A few new overworld secrets has been added.\n-> Added a really obscure overworld secret\n\nAnd here's the big change:\n-> Bombs and Enhanced Bombs base damage has been boosted by 1.\n-> Power Bombs let you place more than one bomb on the same time.\n-> All bow firing velocity has been increased.\n-> New bomb and arrow systems.\n--> Bombs and arrows are now finite, but re-stock quickly over time. (Prevents excessive spamming but let's you use them freely.)\n--> Bomb and arrow upgrades now increases the max cap of bombs and arrows you carry.\n-> Bombs and Arrows are now shown on the HUD.\n-> New shop added that sells upgrades that increases how fast ammo is re-stocked. <-(Unless you start a new file, you'll already have this!!!)\nPreview Video: https://dl.dropboxus...owsAndBombs.mp4\n\n-> Dodongo had it's health increased to better match the new bomb damage.\n-> Made two previous unmovable blocks in level 1 pushable.\n-> There is now a marker on each of the special bars to signify when they are completely full.\n-> Potions renamed from colours to: Life potion, Special potion, Miracle potion.\n-> Reduction to wall masters in some rooms of level 9.\n-> Level 9 now features Firerobes replacing some enemies. Firerobes never respawn.\n-> Added an animation to the boss room door in Confusion to actually show the player when you can't enter it.\n-> Added another path to the item in Confusion.\n-> Added another path to the correct boss door in Confusion.\n--> These two are rather well hidden, but you now don't have to solve the two puzzles players have had a really hard time figuring out.\n-> You now enter the patra room in level 9 in a different way, making the patra not spawn on top of you anymore.\n--> Speaking of which, the darknuts and wallmasters have been replaced with another bubble in that room.\n-> Bow and Arrow items have had their item names changed to fit inside the item name field in the inventory.\n-> Misc bug fixes.\n\nVersion 2.2 Change log:Fixed enemies being able to walk into a specific door in level 6.Wizzrobes can now be hit by Spear melee. (Turning it into the de facto end game main weapon that it was supposed to be.)Some changes were made to the overworld.Difficulty tweaked in most dungeons.Removed herobrine.Gamble game was replaced by a new customly scripted one.Fewer door repairs, and lowered repair costs on those that exist.Cutting grass no longer yields rupoors or blue rupees.Bribed Eppy to play the quest again.A few new rings were coded and added. (One can be find in the ring shop, the others are rare drops.)Fixed a few dungeon map errors.Added a hidden joke dungeon.The infinite wallet now requires you to have the level 9 item in order to be acquired.Changed overworld music for two areas, and added a new track for the new themed area. (Thematics only, no new playing fields.)Added another gambling room earlier in the game.Made a few secrets more obvious.Version 2.1 Change log:Fixed a hint cave entrance not working.Fixed a water secret cave now loading it's content.Misc minor changes.Enemy changes:Wizzrobe 1 (Teleporting.)Arrow defence: 1/4 -> None (No defence.)Wizzrobe 1 (Floating)Arrow defence: Immune -> 1/2 (half)Version 2.0 Change log:\nMajor game rebalance and changes see included link for breakdown: [Link]\n\nVersion 1.1 Change log:Implemented Whistle Warps.Continuing from dungeon entrances is no longer a thing.Due to negative reception, the hint shop in the lower left corner now has its own unique hints.Fixed some design oversights (level3 chest, peahats, etc.)Made some sweeping changes to a single screen on the overworld.More blocks are distinguishable in the level 5 mazes.Arrow upgrade prices were modified to be more in line with the bomb ones.Removed herobrine.Level 2 entrance can now also be pushed open with the bracelet, on top of the previous method.The desert maze is now exit able to the west.Saving and/or continuing in the super secret cave now takes you to the start of the overworld.The only locked (regular key) chest in the game was removed and replaced with lock blocks in order to keep consistency.The dive warp in level 4 for puzzle reseting was made slightly different in order to help players identify its use.Level 5's music was raised in volume slightly.Level 5's boss room was modified in order to provide more hints to the player.Miscellaneous bug fixes.",

    "description": "Well How-de-do there, PureZC, it's been a while! How've you been? How're the wives? Won any good wars recently? I've been good, just enjoying feeling reasonably happy in my own skin for the first time in my life, and so on and so forth, it's pretty awesome. Anyways, I just dug myself up out of this here cave in the ground to present you with this little game here. Nothing special, it's been done before, but I thought that since ZC has come so far since 1.90 and 1.92, I might as well do it to pass some time. And I'm super sorry, but my writing is going to get boring and dry from here on out. I was in semi-history-student-mode when I wrote it, so it reads like that. A lot of it is common knowledge around here, but I wanted to be reasonably thorough. So let's get to it.This introduction is for those who are not too familiar with BS Zelda, and/or those who enjoy a bit of video game history every now and then. If you are not one of these people, feel free to skip straight to the TL;DR at the end.In 1995, Nintendo released the Satellaview, a peripheral for the Super Famicom, in Japan. As the name implies, the add-on was used to pick up satellite broadcast software for the Super Famicom, similarly to things like the Sega Channel for the Sega Genesis. While the attachment was never released outside Japan, it did quite well in its homeland, even while customers were being charged huge fees for the service.During the Satellaview's life-span, there were several games developed specially for the add-on, many of them part of very familiar franchises. There was an F-Zero game for it, a Fire Emblem game, Dragon Quest, Harvest Moon, hell, even Sim City. Among these though were two Zelda games, one of which was aptly titled “BS The Legend of Zelda” – “BS” being short for “Broadcast Satellite.” BS Zelda, as fans have taken to calling it, was for all intents and purposes a scaled back remake of the first game in the series, albeit with some twists: The game was broadcast over the course of four weeks, being broken up into four episodes with certain objectives to complete in a fifty-minute time limit. On top of that, the game featured full voice acting and music, which was broadcast alongside the game data itself, to help move along the plot and to push players in a direction necessary to beat the game in the given time frame. The game's story was also slightly altered, with players playing not as Link, but as the mascots of “BS-X: The Story of the Town Whose Name Was Stolen,” the game/application cartridge used alongside the Satellaview to load games into the console's memory.BS Zelda, as far as Nintendo is concerned, never saw the light of day after service for the Satellaview ended. Of course, it wasn't long before a ROM of the game was leaked onto the Internet. In its original dumped state, however, the game was not very playable, partially due to a combination of emulation issues, the timed nature of the game, and flat-out corrupted data, among other problems.A vibrant community of Zelda fans, hackers, and other such enthusiasts soon cropped up with the mission of restoring these games to a playable state, a goal which while at this point in time has long since been technically achieved, is being pushed further and further all the time. Even our very own Armageddon Games had a part in that: That Romview utility packaged with Zelda Classic? That program was written by Phantom Menace, the creator of Zelda Classic, specifically for BS Zelda, over fifteen years ago. Similarly, the BS Zelda Homepage, which can be considered the core of the BS Zelda community, has a reasonably sized section on BS Zelda content in Zelda Classic. One member of the ZC community several years ago, Vel, even remade the entirety of the game in ZC back in 2004, which is what provided the inspiration for this little project.Even today, the impact of BS Zelda on the Zelda Classic community is not only undeniable, but absolutely inescapable. Anyone who's ever even opened ZQuest in the past decade has most likely come across the term “BS” in regards to the Zelda series. There are innumerable enemies, combo types, quest rules, and so on within Zquest that refer to BS Zelda. Beyond that, virtually all of the most popular tilesets – Pure and Dance of Remembrance, for example – contain a large amount of graphics from BS Zelda.As such, I only find it fitting that after so many years, with so many new additions to Zelda Classic, that someone should go ahead and remake the game once more, to show how far ZC has come as a game engine since Vel's own remake of it in 2004.As a sort of TL;DR, here's the basics: This is a remake of BS The Legend of Zelda in Zelda Classic, because BS Zelda is important to ZC and all that, and because it was done before but ZC has come a long gosh darn way since then. The biggest omission here is the voice acting, which was only ever recorded in Japanese. It has been circumvented, however, with a couple changes to in-game text, and good ol' reliance on the player to explore and experiment.",
    "story": "Ever played the Legend of Zelda? Yes. You have. I'm fairly certain of it. This is pretty much that. Except like you play as the BS-X mascots and not Link, but I put an option to play as Link in here, so don't you worry your poor little heart.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "The game is broken up into four “weeks.” Each of these is fifty minutes long, starting at 0X:07, and ending at 0X:57 – This is how the game was broadcast.\n\nOver the course of the game, gameplay will occasionally halt at certain specific points and something will happen. Sometimes an item will be powered up in some way. Sometimes a fairy will appear. Sometimes all enemies on screen will be killed.\n\nThe only times that the game will save is at the end of each week. Just as you couldn't stop a TV broadcast in the summer of 1995 and come back to it a few days later right where you left off, you can't just save the game in the middle of the thing here!\n\nYou can, however, press the “Ex1” key to skip straight to the end of the week.\n\nThe Map key, usually bound to the space bar, is used here for opening and closing your Objective Screen! This tells you what you should find by the end of the week. This is also the only way of pausing the clock, aside from pausing Zelda Classic as a whole.\n\nBringing up the normal subscreen will not stop time!\n\nWait, I need an actual tip and/or cheat listed here? Okay, here's one. At some point during the first week, a Heart Container will appear at the beach. You will only have about ten minutes to get it before it disappears.",

Enemies here deal a lot of damage and you will get a few game overs, you have been warned. Play this mode only if you want a huge challenge.\n\nYou can choose which either mode to play. Remember that you can't switch modes in game.\nBeating the game on Sweet or Mild will not reward you with anything.\nBeating the game on Bitter will give you the quest password.\n\nUPDATE V.2 (8/12/2015)\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t-Fixed a minor bug in the Hookshot Cave where you can't exit from the bottom.\n\n\n\nUPDATE V.3 (12/9/2015)\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t-Fixed a minor bug that could allow the player to sequence break and battle rank 2 before rank 3.\n-Fixed a VERY minor map bug in level 7.\n\n\n\nUPDATE V.4 (7/13/2020) (MAJOR)\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t-Overhauled enemy placement.\n-Fixed as many typos I could find.\n-Added bitter mode, added quality of life scripts, such as a global difficulty mode in the beginning.\n-Improved cutscenes, Link no longer needs to hold right to go through cutscenes.\n-Changed the music for a couple of levels.\n-Improved the palette in some areas.\n-Improved the intro level art.

    "description": "The Third Legacy is primarily based around the classic NES style of gameplay, meaning that while there may be some obscure secrets and item-based obstacles, there aren't any exceedingly convoluted puzzles or other devious trickery meant to stump the player for days on end. Progressing through the quest should be relatively straight-forward, in as much as the original NES game was ever straight-forward. In this regard, I've tried to make the quest accessible to players who may be familiar with the first 2 quests but new to custom quests, as well as players who've been custom-questing for a while.\n\nSimilarly, the difficulty begins moderately easy, but gradually increases in distinct segments as the quest progresses. This doesn't only apply to challenges in battle, but to increasingly complex dungeon layouts as well. The first segment, The Green Lands, features distinctly classic NES gameplay, enemies, and items. It contains the first 3 dungeons, each of which requires an item from the previous one to access. The second segment, The Desert, adds magic and begins to introduce new ZC items to the gameplay, as well as steps up the enemy roster accordingly. It contains the 4th and 5th dungeons, each of which can be done in any order. The third segment, The Scorched and Frozen Lands, continues to introduce new ZC items, provide new weapon techniques, and unleash new enemies to battle. It contains the 6th and 7th dungeons, each of which can be done in any order. The fourth segment, The Underworld, dramatically raises the tension, and expects that you should have collected the majority of items and upgrades offered up to this point. It contains the 8th dungeon, as well as 3 Trial Caves. Finally, Ganon's Palace is an all-out death-match.\n\nOutside of this progression, however, are 3 Treasure Vault side-dungeons, 1 for each of the first 3 segments, in which you can gain powerful items - if you're willing to fight tooth and nail for them. These are optional, but highly recommended, as the items will significantly aid you for quite a while after attaining them.\n\nUPDATE - SEPTEMBER 08, 2019 - v1.2 RELEASED!\n\nThe following are a few of the most significant highlights. A full list of detailed changes can be found in the text file. Now requires ZC 2.53.0 R2 or later.\n\nGeneral:\n* New area: Cave of Steel.\n* Enabled \"More Sound Effects\" for everything except push blocks and enemy fireballs.\n* Added pickup strings with functionality descriptions for all major items not sold in shops.\n* Removed significant amounts of unused resources.\n\nGameplay:\n* Wizzrobe Summoners limited again. These enemies now use a scripted system to restrict their total summons to an average of 8-12 per room, depending on summon type. As before, this is a primary reason for the v1.2 update.\n* Some enemies with high HP and speed given minor reductions.\n* Most Underworld enemies can be 1-hit-killed by reflected magic.\n* Some magic-consuming enemies can drop magic-refilling fairies.\n* Gleeok (Normal/Fire) can be damaged by Silver or Gold Arrows.\n* L3 Leevers no longer hide underground in rooms where killing all enemies is required.\n* L5 Darknuts never return after death.\n* Bombchus use Super Bomb explosions on contact [requires ZC 2.53.0 RC2].\n* All enemies that previously blocked Cane of Byrna beams now ignore them.\n\nInterface & Interaction:\n* Minimaps revised/repositioned for cross-quest consistency.\n* Level-specific key color set/corrected for all subscreens on all levels.\n* Added gray heart & magic container placeholders on subscreen to indicate total possible containers.\n* Subscreen heart & magic container rows arranged in same direction (left to right) as original Zelda 1.\n* Active subscreen arrangement tweaked for Overworld, Underworld, and general caves.\n* Added Overworld continue points at transitions between The Green Lands, The Desert, and The Scorched and Frozen Lands.\n* Player also continues from last used dungeon entrance.\n* Many secrets and obstacles remain permanently open or removed, even in dungeons.\n* Link has falling animation and sound when stepping into pits.\n* Can skip dialogue with B button.\n\nItems & Equipment:\n* New item: Steel Boots (no magic cost to walk on spikes).\n* Magic system reworked; Magic Boots now drain magic at half their original rate.\n* Magic Ring (Light Force) no longer provides infinite magic; only a fast refill rate.\n* Heart Rings & Magic Rings refill slightly faster and have consistent timing across their 3 levels.\n* Lens of Truth reveals pushable dungeon blocks.\n* Added \"whimsy sound\" for Whimsical Ring hits.\n* Stone of Gravity revised to function properly in ZC 2.53.0 RC2.\n* Some item prices reduced by 15 - 25 rupees.\n\nLayout & Visuals:\n* Added Maps & Compasses to the 3 Treasure Vaults, the 4 previous Caves, and Underworld Ruin.\n* Compass stops blinking on item pickup/boss kill in side dungeons.\n* Moved northwest Underworld shop to Overworld above Cave of the Dead entrance; reduced prices.\n* Added new shop in place of northwest Underworld shop. [Item list: Whisp Ring 1, Cane of Byrna, Stone of Gravity]\n* Under-dungeon passageways/item chambers can no longer be exited from sides.\n* Certain water combos and other empty spaces no longer block Hookshot.\n* Smoothed animations for dungeon/cave waters.\n* Custom whistle-blown pond animation sequence; new colors, no ladder functionality, faster transition from full to drained.\n* Added/tweaked brick dividers in freeform dungeon areas.\n* All Trap positions marked with 5-rivet tile.\n* Pushable rocks use solid black color; shadows don't disappear while moving.\n* Consistent upper-screen solidity in rooms with guys.\n* Twin flames restored in general caves with guys.\n* Added permanent shortcuts through all rooms in Treasure Vault 3's hallway of obstacles.\n\nUnfortunately, due to core changes in scripts and functionality, save files from previous versions are not compatible with this update.\n\n\n\tv1.1 summary \n\tUPDATE - APRIL 10, 2016 - v1.1 RELEASED!\n\nThe following are a few of the most significant highlights. A full list of detailed changes, including specific enemy and item stats, can be found in the text file.\n\nGeneral:\n* Multiple levels (DMaps) now compiled into single maps. Previously, each DMap had its own corresponding map; now, anywhere from 2 to 4 DMaps (and in one case, 7 DMaps) have been placed within single maps, using DMap offsets to replicate the original positioning. As a result, the map count has been reduced from 44 to 16, and the file size decreased by 599K. (This is strictly a matter of file organization and has no effect on gameplay.)\n* MIDI file information reconfigured to display proper credits and instrumentation in \"Quest MIDI Info...\" listing.\n* 2.50.2 compatibility confirmed.\n\nGameplay:\n* Wizzrobe Summoners limited. This is the primary reason for the v1.1 update. Previously, a single Summoner had the capacity to fill a screen to its 500-enemy limit, resulting in an incredulous flood of enemies if not dispatched immediately. Now, by modifying a series of Wizzrobe Bat Summoners to mimic the original Summoners, 40-enemy limits have been enforced on all summons, resulting in far more manageable challenges and far less system strain. Additionally, a number of summons have been weakened in a variety of ways, whether by moving slower, firing less projectiles, having less HP, splitting into fewer children, or becoming normal splitters rather than tribbles.\n* Underworld difficulty level considerably decreased. It seems most players aren't into chaotic finales like I am, therefore the final third of the game has undergone major changes to keep the difficulty increase at a ramp rather than an exponential curve. Most enemies have had HP reductions between 15 - 40%, others have had step speeds slowed and attack damages decreased, and almost all enemies now have an adequate chance of a 3-heart drop upon death. Additionally, a majority of bosses from the second half of the quest have had HP and damage reductions (the BS-Zelda bosses in particular), and some now have new weapon weaknesses.\n* Implemented Lejes' Fire Trail reduction script to reduce flame duration for fire-dropping enemies. Fire Zol flame duration reduced from over 10 seconds to under 6 seconds, now leaving a maximum of 4 trails behind them. Rooms with fire-dropping Patras vary from 4 to 8 seconds.\n\nInterface & Interaction:\n* Dungeon Maps now display full-color layouts with doors, locks, boss locks, entryways, and bombable walls visibly marked.\n* Compass positions on each floor of Frozen Dungeon now indicate stairs leading to Triforce room.\n* All fairy life-restoration rings are now life-and-magic-restoration rings.\n* Cactus damages lowered by half.\n* Old Man in Underworld entry-tree gives directions to the 3 Trial Caves.\n* Enabled cheats. See text file (or \"Hints & Cheats\" below) for hints.\n\nItems & Equipment:\n* Link isn't hurt by own fire weapons.\n* Magic Shield now blocks flame attacks.\n* Sword beams can now be fired down to 91% health (e.g with 6 hearts, beams fire at 5.25 hearts; with 16 hearts, at 14.5; with 24 hearts, at 21.75).\n* Peril Ring/Peril Scroll now activate damage divisor/sword beam at 2 hearts rather than 1.\n* Nayru's Love duration increased from 512 to 640; magic cost raised from 2 containers to 3 (originally 4).\n* Black Ring damage divisor reduced from 16 to 12.\n* Many significant item prices reduced by 25 - 50 rupees.\n\nLayout & Visuals:\n* Added slightly tweaked dirt/sand tiles to indicate whistle-blown staircases.\n* Added darker stumps to indicate burnable trees in dungeons.\n* Maps moved to earlier rooms in first four dungeons.\n* Desert Dungeon & Inferno Dungeon palette brightness/saturation moderately reduced; color casts slightly shifted.\n* Recolored CSet 6 lava-water in Scorched Lands using CSet 8 to prevent sprite-palette-based color-shifts; smoothed animation.\n* Added step-switch in Desert Dungeon to permanently raise tiles across hyper-spike room leading to boss segment.\n* Blocked some segments of water in Underworld Dungeon/Cave of Life on which player could get stuck using Two-Way Ladder.\n* Added the Winchester cave.\n",

Features include, but are not limited to, the following:A full 8x8 overworld.Six intricate dungeons: four in the main game, two in the post game.Two playable characters: Finnigan, the typical ZC protagonist, and Xaya, who trades most forms of defense for extra offense and speed.Thirteen scripted bosses/minibosses to challenge you.Lots of scripted items, such as a magic leaf, a fire rod, and a Moosh transformation.Haribo Sugar-Free Gummy Bears (toilet plunger not included).A deep, emotional yet humorous story.An alternate universe story and a sequel built in to the quest.The typical insanity you'd expect from putting Moosh and Russ together in a room with a ZC.And more!Update! 1/6/2019:\nFixed some bugs and tile errors, made an often-missed HCP a little easier to spot, and added a script that will alert you if you play the quest in the wrong version number to avoid version compatibility bugs.\n\nUpdate 12/6/2018:\nNothing of real substance in this update, just some minor bugfixes involving pits in the final dungeon and side warps sending you to the wrong dmap.\n\nUpdate 8/23/2018:\nThis was a bit overdue, but we (and by we I mean Moosh, Russ did nothing but sit and applaud) finally got around to updating the quest with some much needed fixes. We changed a song that was bugging ZC to ogg, so be sure to redownload the music if you plan on playing again. It also has been updated to 2.5.2, so please play in that version or higher, or you'll likely run into compatibility bugs in the basement of level 2.\n\n\tChangelog \n\t\n-New Moosh sprites, courtesy of Shane\n-Balance changes to some techs\n-Bonus dungeon bugfixes (finally)\n-Miscellaneous polish stuff\n-Two jokes\n",
    "story": "Long ago, the blood god Akuma and bear spirit Moosh waged a great war against each other. Knowing that he would be unable to attain victory, Moosh sealed the demon away with the help of a local village. Before leaving them to rest, Moosh promised that one day, when the seal on Akuma weakened, an avatar of Moosh would be born among them to stop the demon.Years have passed since then. The peaceful village lived quietly and contently under the curse of Akuma, which prevented them from stopping without first smashing into something. But they managed. One morning, a youth Finnigan went out to meet with his friend Xaya, the daughter of the village's leader. She'd been troubled by her visions recently, dreams of Akuma breaking forth from the seal. But she'd had another vision, one of the Moosh statue at the town's center. Going off Xaya's vision, Finnigan touched the statue, causing it to slide away and reveal a hidden staircase.Xaya's father explained to the youth that this meant he was the avatar of Moosh. Blessed with the power of free movement and the ability to temporarily transform himself into an incarnation of Moosh, it would be up to Finnigan to find the three Crystal Spring Bananas and stop Akuma from breaking free from his seal. Accepting this responsibility, Finnigan set out to find the three bananas.But as Xaya's visions grow worse and worse, will he be able to find them in time?",

It started as a quest back then for Avataro's birthday, but I\ndecided to pick it up again, and added more content. Originally, it was just one dungeon, two caves and the last area with a 7 screen designed overworld. NOW, it's a 3x3 overworld with 3 dungeons, two caves, and the last area. A few changes have been made compared to the original version, mostly to provide enough content to be considered a miniquest.\n\nLike I stated before, this is a parody of Avataro's \"Well, that's something!\" series. What can you expect from this quest?\n\n- Questionable design.\n- Bad jokes (with a few vulgar words here and there).\n- Questionable Difficulty (especially in the second and third dungeons). \n- Enough entertainment for an hour or an hour and a half.\n- Custom bosses.\n\nOh, before I forget, I decided to do something evil as well. No F6ing allowed! This was intended as a design choice to prevent some players to go the easy way out on hard situations. However, I did include a Link Doll item that serves as a way to save your progress, so I recommend you use it often.\n\nOne last word: This quest is intended to be difficult, so I won't bother on changing anything unless something is considered to be too much. (Difficulty is like a normal to hard mode range, so experienced ZC players shouldn't have too much trouble).",

Especially since you can't F6 out of the game.\n- Pay attention to your surroundings! Some secrets are easy to reveal if you know where to look at.",

Do you sometimes throw away a jar of mayonnaise that still has some mayo left at the bottom simply because it's to hard to scrape it out? Have you already beaten Armageddon Quest and Liberation of Hyrule and are just sitting around the house all day dying of boredom constantly thinking to yourself \"great, now what am I supposed to do?\" Well, if you've answered yes to any two of these questions then good news! \n\nThis was one of my first (and first unfinished) quests I ever made back in 2007 and is the 3rd and final iteration of the demo. It features mostly 2.11 challenge-quest style gameplay--ie., 2.10 style custom bosses with scripts--and also amazingly hideous color palettes! (Yay Malboro Green and Hot Pink!) Also, it is very difficult in some ways that are different from other challenge quests. Sometimes needing superhuman reaction time is a thing. There's no tricks to it. It just crushes you fair and square. \n\n..Enjoy!\n\n\n*********** !!!! WARNING !!!! ***********\n\nThis quest is HARD and so it may not be fun to play depending on your preferences.\nThis was a very early mini-quest originally made in early 2.10 and then 2.11+ and so may have dubious design decisions and difficulty flaws which may prompt one into hurling projectiles and cursing.\nIf you are sensitive to flashing lights this quest may not be for you.\nIf you are taking any prescription drugs ask your doctor if Dungeon Impossible is right for you.\nDo not drive while playing Dungeon Impossible. Please play responsibly.\n\n***********!!! END WARNING !!! ***********\n\n\nQ: What's the DX stand for?\nA: Died something... I forget.\n\nQ: How hard is it? Can I beat it.. or what?\nA: Hard. But don't worry, it's got a new game mode that let's you play it from within your mind after they ship you off to the looney bin.\n\nQ: How many hearts did you start with in the original?\nA: 10.

The quest has now been updated from its original incarnation, nearly doubling in length. Explore several unique areas with three different characters, each with their own fully-scripted arsenals. Several hidden items and upgrades exist for those who search thoroughly. Twenty special challenges are also spread throughout the world, culminating in the most complex superboss ZC has yet produced.

No matter what happens, do not approach the tower at the edge of town. It absolutely must not be climbed.A young woman named Emily, growing resentful of her mundane life, decided to break that one rule and climb the tower. To her surprise, she found a whole new world waiting for her at the top, with yet another tower. Enlisting the aid of the initially-reluctant Lucas, she set out to climb the series of towers before her, hoping the uncover the meaning behind it all. The truth would turn out to be far beyond anything the two of them could imagine.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "The biggest tip I can give is to explore. Each \"overworld\" area between the towers has two heart containers hidden, for a maximum of 1,000 HP. There are also several hidden weapons that will greatly simplify matters. When in doubt, check the minimap. It can reveal if a secret path to another screen exists.For the postgame, three data discs are hidden in each main area. Some are accessible in the main game, while others require you to complete the main game and unlock Caelan. The challenge menu itself can be accessed from the screen to the right of Caelan's house.For those who value minor graphical changes, a swimsuit exists hidden near the beginning of the game. It's only a cosmetic change, but it can be fun to play around with.As with all Russ quests, the password is available upon completion of the quest. The script files are included in the download for those who are curious.",
    "credits": "First, I want to give a special thank you to Aevin. Without him, this quest would have turned out very differently. He contributed the main character sprites, beta tested, and gave constant feedback through the development process. His role in shaping the quest can hardly be understated.Graphics:-Most graphics were made by Moosh.-Snowy mountain background from Kirby's Adventure, ripped by Mephea of VGMaps.-Moon background from Megaman 5, ripped by VGMaps.-Star background made by Jupiter.-Main character sprites made by Aevin.-Giant statue sprite ripped from Starbound.Music:-Full music credits can be found in the music folder",

Except you, you need to die, a lot.\n\n\nWell, what can I say, this is a quest that was heavily inspired by dayday, and it was produced over only a few days. It's a short joke quest that does not take itself serious, not one bit. I'd like to stress that, this quest the bottom barrel or joke quests in many ways, so if you're going into this with any expectations what-so-ever, then you're doing it wrong. Many design decisions were made because I thought they would be the most obnoxious rather actually add anything to the experience. I fully accept that most people will hate the entire experience, that being said, I do think it's worth completing for the very-much-so anticlimactic final boss fight.\n\n\n\n\nNow, NightNight is a very sophisticated experience, so try and not put any spoilers in your reviews and comments~ (But if you do, clearly mark them!)\n\n\nDO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO HELP ZULDA SAVE RADRULE?",

Since it is my first quest I decided to keep things simple, no scripting or layers, and try something more complex with a future quest. I also stuck with the original tile set. While I didn't make any new enemies I did soup up some of the existing enemies to make things a bit more challenging. This quest uses the standard 8 dungeons to get the Triforce pieces and a 9th dungeon to rescue Zelda from Gannon. Both the overworld and the dungeons get increasingly difficult as you progress. In the future I'd like to try other tilesets, scripting, and if I can figure out how, custom enemies but for now I hope you enjoy what I've made.",

    "description": "\nAfter a few months, this project is finally complete. This project re-creates the first Legend of Zelda in the 2.5 version of the Classic tileset, as well as in the Koten set. This includes the first, and second quests. This quest is also unpassworded, so anyone is free to open it up, look around, and see how things where done in the first Legend of Zelda. You are also free to package this, and use it with you own ZC forks, now that ZC is open source. My goal is that this becomes a learning tool, and a pack-in for ZC.\n\nA bit about the development:\nI started a thread wondering if there was something like this that already existed. When there wasn't, I decided to take it upon myself to re-create the first game using 2.5's Classic tile set layout. I completely redrew the OW from scratch. The dungeons in the first quest where also re-created screen by screen. For the second quest, I imported the dungeon maps into the quest file, and replaced the tiles in the newer versions. This turned out to be faster, cause I didn't have to set screens up outside of their graphics. This was a learning experience for me, even.\n\nThere were some additions, and changes that I've made to Koten, and even Classic to make this as faithful to the NES version(s) as possible, which I thought was kind of funny. Most of these are aesthetic changes.The new version of Classic uses animated water. When you drain the lake with the whistle, the drained water still animates, as it only changes the palette, this looked weird, so Classic got some stationary water for those screens. Koten had to have some similar water additions cause the drained lake screen secrets don't work outside of Classic properly.\n\nHere's some other random notes, and changes made for Koten.Removed extra pixels from left/ right doors which made them look off next to the walls.Corrected the dungeon template on the left side of the screen. This is still technically off, but it is better than it was. I don't feel like applying the template to every screen by hand, since the \"apply Template to all\" just doesn't work for whatever reason. This should be fully corrected in the second quest, and I might, MIGHT make an update later if I feel motivated to the first quest. It's just not that big of a deal.Made the water solid.Added palettes for Link's blue, red, and gold ring. (custom)Added sprite c-sets for Aquamentus, Digdogger, Gleeok, and Ganon. (copied from elsewhere in the set)Added \"Dry Lake\" Water tiles.Changed Lv2 Moblins from that weird orange, to a blue c-set.Added names to all d-maps, for learning purposes.\nIf there any bugs (which there shouldn't be) please let me know so I can fix them ASAP.\n\nUpdates:\n\nUpdated 4.15.16 (1.3)Thanks to PureZC's kind staff, I am able to submit this to the database. Thank you, Aevin, and Nimono.  (And any others who had a role in this)\n\nUpdated 4.11.16 (1.2)Found, and added authentic NES music in the form of an .nsf file that must be placed in the same folder as ZC.Added a very brief readme to explain how .nsf files work.\n\nUpdated 4.6.16 (1.1)Fixed ending strings.Fixed ladder in Koten 1st.Fixed OW mini-map in Koten 2nd.Added corner traps to the Bow room, and the room before Gohma in both 1st Quests.\nVersion 1.0 was released on 4.5.16.\n\nAnd happy belated 30th, Zelda series!",
    "story": "\n(Copied from the manual)\n \nIn the distant past, when the world was still in chaos…\nIn a small kingdom in the Hyrule region, golden triangles with mystical powers – known as Triforces – were passed down from generation to generation.\nOne day, however, the Great Demon King Ganon, who sought to rule the world with darkness and fear, invaded this kingdom with his evil army and stole the Triforce of “Power”.\nFearing his evil reign, Zelda, the princess of this small kingdom, in an attempt to protect the remaining Triforce of “Wisdom”, split it into eight fragments and hid them throughout the land.\nAt the same time, she ordered Impa, her most trustworthy nursemaid, to search for someone brave enough to defeat Ganon and helped her secretly escape.\nUpon learning of this, Ganon grew furious, imprisoned the princess, and sent pursuers after Impa.\nImpa desperately fled through forests and over mountains, but, eventually out of energy, she found herself surrounded by Ganon’s minions.\nShe was in a desperate situation!\nJust then, a lone boy appeared, skillfully confused the minions, and rescued Impa.\nHis name was Link. He came across this situation during a journey.\nImpa told him the entire story.\nLink, burning with a sense of justice, resolved to rescue the princess, but to stand up against Ganon and his Triforce of “Power” he absolutely must gather the fragments of the Triforce of “Wisdom” and complete it.\nOtherwise, he won’t even be able to infiltrate Death Mountain, where Ganon lives.\nWill Link be able to defeat Ganon and save the princess?\nIt all rests on YOUR skill.",

    "description": "Yeto's Quest is a quest which is infamous for being one of the worst (at least one of the lowest rated) quests in the database. Nonetheless, it is a quest I quite enjoyed playing (and you can see why by reading my review.) I wanted to create a quest which allowed others to experience some of what I found so great about it while actually being playable and bug free. That being said, this is not just a remake or cleanup of Yeto's Quest; it is very much its own quest.\n\nBasically, you can expect a quest that requires a great deal of careful exploration and tricky puzzle solving. While there are single-room puzzles, many of the puzzles are much broader in scope. Much of your exploration will slowly teach you how the world works, and what you learn will help you discover the secrets you need to move forward. Combat in general is not very difficult, but the bosses are extremely challenging - the scripted battles in this quest have a more sophisticated AI than the typical pattern many scripted fights seem to follow. Enemies are cognizant of things like spacing and weapon range, and may make defensive moves instead of offensive ones. These combat experiences are meant as a battle of wits and involve careful thought and planning.\n\nThis is a quest which aims to question typical conceptions of \"good design\" and \"bad design.\" There are numerous aspects of this quest which, out of context, would generally be considered \"bad design\" decisions; however, they are twisted in a way which not only subverts them, but, in my opinion, creates a unique, thought-provoking experience. The biggest mistake you can make while playing this quest is to assume anything based on traditional design decisions. There are plenty of points in this quest where you are intentionally given partial information in such a way that the typical extrapolation of this knowledge leads to completely false conclusions.\n\nThat being said, this quest is not for everyone. Only people who are patient and can approach it with an open mind will be able to enjoy the quest. You will get stuck. You will be fooled. You will need to be careful and thorough. All these not because I enjoy causing people to suffer - it is quite the opposite: in overcoming more difficult challenges, greater satisfaction can be felt. These are intended to be true, mentally stimulating challenges, not cheap tricks or unfair rooms filled with death - brute force is not the answer.\n\nIt is worth noting that this quest has a fairly significant amount of scripts for various mechanics and aesthetics. While most of the scripting is not completely in your face, it is good to keep this in the back of your mind since this means the quest may break typical ZC conventions.\n\nWhile the quest can easily be beaten in under two hours if you know what you're doing, a first playthrough will likely take over ten.\n\nWARNING: This is NOT a joke quest. This is a serious effort at creating an interesting and enjoyable quest; it took a little over two years to develop. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of humor, but don't go into this expecting a bunch of nonsense and memes.\n\n\nUpdate (5/30/2016):\n-Slightly lowered damage and HP for some boss fights.\n-Fairy statues now refill bombs once you've found them.\n-Made a extremely minor change that no one will ever notice.",
    "story": "Not long ago, an archaeologist set off on a journey in search of a lost artifact.This artifact would serve as proof of the claims made by a certain dying religion.As one of this religion's last remaining disciples, he took his task very seriously.His travels took him to a snowy island with a large, foreboding castle...",
    "tipsAndCheats": "You can retrieve keys after using them.This is a quest that has save points. If you die or quit, you will lose progress back to your previous save, so make sure to save often.Some secrets may feel arbitrary at first, but this quest has a great deal of internal consistency. That is to say, if you find something behaves in a non-standard way at some place in the quest, it will act similarly everywhere else. (I realize this is extremely vague, but it will become clear what I mean by this as you make progress in the quest.)No maze paths have a solution.Using brute force to find your way through dark rooms or across invisible paths is never required.You cannot get stuck into a situation where you have to die or quit. If you think you are in such a situation, search carefully for a way out, and you will likely learn something important in the process.The map is an extremely important tool. I made sure that the information on it accurately reflects the state of the game, including secrets, key usage, and other changes that may occur in rooms.",

Furthermore, some additional content has been added to the game in the form of a couple of extra items and dungeons.\n\n\nAt it's heart, Legend of Lana is a quest that got inspired by Hyrule Warriors and the characters in it.\nAfter seeing the NES overworld in that game and the sprites, I got quite inspired, and asked myself: What would it be like if you could play as Lana in Zelda 1? This is what the original Legend of Lana tried to be, going as far as using the original Zelda 1 overworld. In the DX edition of the quest a lot has been changed and expanded upon, including it's own overworld.\n\nItems and enemies in this quest function very different from Zelda 1 and most Zelda classic quests. For example, arrows work on most wizzrobes and darknutz (assuming you don't hit their shields). You'll also have an unlimited supply of bombs and arrows once you have acquired them, though with the caveat that you can't spam them too much as they are on a re-charge timer. Lana also doesn't carry a shield, so you'll have to dodge more projectiles compared to Link. But your main weapon is also a ranged projectile that can multi-hit, meaning that you don't need to get as close to strike most enemies.\n\nAs of the DX version, this quest now comes with two difficulty levels: Normal and Hard. Normal is the main experience that this quest was crafted for, and as such is the recommended one. Hard is mainly for those who have beaten the DX version, as it offers enemies that deal double damage as well as larger and more complex dungeon layouts, sort of like a second quest, if you will, but without the overworld scrambling.\n\nIn regards to other features this quest offers:Nine main dungeonsA couple of hidden bonus dungeonsAround two maps worth of overworldStone collecting side questAchievementsRetro tracker music OSTBad jokesPuns\nUpdated 1.1 Changelog:\n\n\t \n\tFixed a door in level 8 not working.\nFixed a warp in Lunatic Tower not working.\nImplemented map functionality properly for Lunatic Tower.\nFixed a bug where Nayru's Embrace could randomly be used without costing any special.\nFixed the frame rate being crap before a certain item was found.\nMade some rooms in both versions of level 5 slightly easier to see in.\nMade a secret in Tropara actually have a visual cue, where as previously it did not.\nAdded a minor visual cue to a room in level 8.\nPossibly other minor changes/bug fixes.\n",

    "description": "Basically done to show off some spriting and tilework I had done for both overworld and dungeon tiles in classic, Magic and Fantasy doesn't do a lot of things fancy. It aims to impress by keeping the technical details simple and workable. That said, it still maintains a strong epic feeling which promises players an epic adventure across the grand kingdom of Hyrule. With this in mind, I do want to mention that the quest makes use of some nifty little Zquest tricks.UPDATE - Oct. 17 2017 - Magic and Fantasy has been drastically updated.- new graphics - certain areas of the map have had graphical additions or tweaks. This includes new background tiles on Death Mountain, a smoke effect around Kakariko Village, and a forest canopy effect over portions of the western and eastern overworld. Abei and Ama have also been resprited.- new songs - certain parts of the overworld have been divided off into their own Dmaps and given their own background music.- Level 8 shortcut - a certain shortcut leading to level 8 has been addressed. Level 8 has a lot of buildup for the final dungeon and isn't appropriate to access early, so this has thankfully been dealt with.- other tweaks - some of the message strings have been changed a little bit in cases where something might have been too cryptic, or a plot element flew over someone's head, or something. Basically, I'm listening to you guys. Also, more caves, more rupees, the ability to upgrade your bomb supply to a total of 16, better mileage for the hammer, and more challenging difficulty later on.UPDATE - Oct. 22- fatal error patched - Level 9 was inaccessible- 16th heart added- apparently Armos in snowy environments routinely stand on actual snow despite having been in that position for god knows how long. BECAUSE IT MAKES A GOOD UNDER COMBO- other things I'll pretend were always there but I really snuck in.",

Swords clashing, people screaming... nobody outside knew what was going on, but soon monsters started appearing all over the kingdom.

What would they do without the Triforce of Power, in possession of the sealed Dark Lord?One young man from the local village sets foot in the castle, unarmed, looking for answers. His query unravels into a grand quest to reassemble the shattered Triforce of Courage and deliver the princess from evil once again.",

But on the bright side, it includes an item randomizer for those who like those.The quest is \"inspired\" by NES conventions. Sure, a 9 dungeon quest isn't new, but a quest made in a Pure Tileset having dungeons NOT in obvious structures? Also, the quest is a little non-linear. You can usually get the first or second item in a dungeon and leave to explore more of the world. Coming back to earlier dungeons with later items opens new shortcuts, and you will need to come back to Level 1 for some of the items.Update 1.1: Fixed some rando logic bugs, future proofing fixes, small subscreen changes, added Item Tally for areas (totally doesn't lie).",

I've already made several of these, this one is a little different.For the most part, gameplay is more inspired by the Original Zelda 1. Things like key items sold in shops (sometimes at high prices), Old Men offering an item only if you have the hearts, and a simple 9 dungeon single overworld. There are a few improvements over the old formula, like diagonal movement, sword slashing, better candles, arrow ammo, and 2 items per dungeon.This time, you can randomize more than items. You can change the world too. Watch as shopkeepers rip you off, you need to show a new tunic to be allowed into Level 9, and find the Magic Key requires 12 hearts to pick up.Oh, and you can end up playing dungeons from 21 different quest sets, grouped in 3 main categories: Classic, BS, and Outlands. You can even have them mix and match, with interesting results.So, choose how you want to play, save Zelda, and then try again. Things are never the same. Well, unless you enter a seed or choose to play one of the 21 quests normally.The 1.1 expansion is OUT! Not only are there more overworlds and dungeons, there are also more scripted items that may show up and multiple gameplay improvements.1.11 fixes a few bugs, and also adds a difficulty feature for those who want exploring easier or closer to Zelda 1 style.1.2 adds options to have random hints and dungeon music.1.3 adds the ability to mark your Ex3 map with A and B and create a seed made up of 4 letter words for easier sharing.1.4 more seed button shortcuts, game time starts at 0:00 after randomizer finishes. Plays fine in 2.53.",
    "story": "If you are familiar with the story of Zelda 1 then nothing new to see here.Otherwise....Ganon kidnaps Zelda. Zelda scattered the Triforce of Wisdom. For some reason you need the Triforce of Wisdom to go into the lair Ganon is hiding in. Find the Silver Arrow (or some variation) to slay the King of Evil, rescue Zelda, and Save Hyrule. Or Outlands, whichever happens to show up.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Although there are 8 hint guys hidden in the overworld that give good general tips, knowing a few things ahead of time will help.Dungeons have 2 items each. This means many familiar levels now have an additional item hidden inside.Only single blocks can be pushed in a dungeon room. Pay attention to rooms with seemingly random lone blocks mixed into larger structures.If you get Spin Attack, you can poke walls in the overworld to find bombable spots easier.Look everywhere. I mean everywhere.The Ex Buttons are used in this quest. Especially Ex3 and Ex4 as a nice checklist features.Likewise, the Map Button (usually Space Bar by default) gets some use in the main menus. It even counts as a \"select\" button of sorts.Okay, there is a big secret in the form of additional randomizer features. You may get a clue from a random joke, but to speed things up, there is a certain point where holding UP and MAP when confirming with A will lead you there.",

This whole quest was made in a week.\n\nUses exactly one FFC script in one room. Other than that, this quest is script-free.\n\nThis quest doesn't try to push the envelope, really. It's just supposed to be a fun diversion.

If you combine your skills and cooperate as a team, then you can accomplish anything!\n\nLink and Zelda must work together:Ex2: Switch characters to wield different weapons and use items differently!Ex3: Your partner can help you fight with auto-attack!Ex4: Separate to solve puzzles from two different places, or dodge monsters by switching from far away!\nWield a panoply of magical items:Cane of SomariaBeetleSpinnerNew B-Button LadderMagnetSwitch HookHorse CallShield that can push enemiesMany, many more! 36 active item slots in all.\nExplore 2 complete overworlds:Non-linear layout from the very beginning, with many different ways you can go to progress.Even mix of overhead and sideview gameplay.

Continue from the overworld to change settings again at any time.Averted Ambush Mode: A special trick you can perform in the intro sequence lets you start the game with a bunch of items, complete things in an even more optional order, and potentially end the game in a different way to fight a special variant final boss.Error Mode: Simulate a malfunctioning, corrupted game cartridge for strange, random experiences! This may change your inventory, so be sure to copy your file first if you try this mode.Swordless challenge: Just for difficulty, you can skip the sword until the final battle.

    "description": "Legend of Pokemon Warrior is a crossover of a crossover. Although there are many Pokemon related jokes, most of the enemies are actually from Dragon Warrior Monsters. Hence the name, Legend of Zelda + Pokemon + Dragon Warrior.The quest is split into multiple small themed overworlds. In each, you can find a portal to the next world but it is sealed and locked with a boss lock. Explore each world and the side dungeon to find as many items as possible to break these seals and travel to the next world.Can't seem to progress in a dungeon? Only an item near the entrance can be reached right away. The deeper parts require items that may not have appeared up to that point. Expect some backtracking to finish off earlier dungeons.Oh, and I guess this is also a randomizer. Besides randomizing items, you can also shuffle the caves around in each individual world. You can play without anything randomized, but where's the fun in that?Update 1.1: Fixed several bugs including a serious Framerate issue, added features from more recent projects like compass tone. Also updated one of the secret modes and added another one. Play though this series of increasingly \"impossible\" modes to discover the next.Update 1.2: Game time starts at 0:00 after randomizer finishes running. Compass helps more in Infinite Dungeon. Other fixes, plays fine in 2.53.Update 1.3: Future Proofing fixes, a certain boss shouldn't remain invincible as often, added more secret Names",

The only question is, how many of these worlds are there?",
    "tipsAndCheats": "For the most part, each new world has two new requirements. One required item is needed to break the seal just to reach the world, while the other is required to fully explore the new world and usually reach the boss key with it.Compasses point to where the boss key is. No exceptions.Maps are not totally useless. Besides showing the shape of the overworld, it also has a secret additional feature if you bothered to grab a checklist.Speaking of which, don't ignore that portal in the first cave.There may be clues worth writing down.By now you should expect these kind of quests to have greater than 100% item collection. The magic number this time is 105%. How many items is that? Do the math!Want to try something different? You can get extra lines of text during the intro by using certain names or other things.",

    "description": "This is an overhaul of a quest I made for Gouanaco's 24-hour Quest Contest. Naturally, that version had a number of rough edges and rushed areas, yet it turned out better than I expected, so I gave myself another 12 hours to revise it to (my own) acceptable standards. The new version has nearly twice as many items and secrets, large price reductions on previous items, more manageable high-level enemies, many visual design enhancements, multiple continue points across the overworld, a customized subscreen, and most of all, an expanded final dungeon that fits the progression of the first 3.\n\nConditionally, the quest was designed in 36 hours. Per the contest rules, resources such as tile sheets, music, sounds, and scripts were allowed to be gathered before the designing phase began. Then, once compiled, the countdown began. Minor malfunctions and other glitches were allowed to be fixed after construction, so long as we worked with what we had at the time limit. The 36-hour update followed the same guidelines, in which I finished all additional design in 12 hours, then corrected functionality issues and brief tile errors afterward.\n\nThe end result is a short and simple quest that features a slightly expanded classic-based tileset, a clear-cut 4-segmented overworld with 4 straight-forward dungeons, a story in which you go through things to collect things to open things to defeat things, a variety of characters that may or may not know more than one identical sentence, and traditional tried-and-true gameplay, all culminating in a climactic face off with Standard Ganon. Due to the quest's rushed production, you'll also find a few items / enemies / design themes / gimmicks rehashed from my first quest. Further, the quest features exceptionally Ben-tastic dialogue, as the contest was anonymous and it was suggested we spoof other designers' styles and gimmicks to confuse players.\n\n...what, you wanted profound originality, groundbreaking graphics, sprawling dungeons, epic purpose-driven story, intricate character development, and fully scripted interfaces, all while forcing a 36-hour limit on me? Ha! You get What You Deserve.\n\nUPDATE - SEPTEMBER 08, 2019 - v1.2 RELEASED!\n\nThis is a maintenance release that updates scripts to be compatible with newer versions of ZC, provides accurate transparency, adds proper pit functionality, tweaks some graphics and animations, improves certain item/obstacle interactions, and heavily optimizes file resources. No changes to gameplay or layout were made. Now requires ZC 2.53.0 R2 or later.",

FASTER features:\n\n-A 5 by 5 overworld with lots of small secrets\n-2 dungeons featuring some challenging combat\n-A hall of fame including the fastest speedruns of the quest (see more information below)\n\nSince this game is designed to be speedrun, I thought it would only be appropriate to include a hall of fame sort of deal. Right now, since the quest has not been released, the hall of fame has place holder names. But PM me with your times to get included in the hall of fame in future updates of the quest. Runs with video or pictures will be prioritized over runs without any context or evidence. Also right now the only category being included is real time, meaning the in game time is irrelevant (use a timer online, anything like that to keep track).

This is basically a free win.\n-The quest is unpassworded. Feel free to look over it. This can be helpful for trying to find the best path for a speedrun.

    "description": "Welcome to TLoZ: Beginnings, a short Z1 style quest aimed at giving people a very nostalgic feel. I tried to challenge myself and make it so that the quest is as non-linear as possible. Because of that, almost the whole world is open to you as soon as you start and it is possible to get into most dungeons early. Sequence breaking is encouraged if you wish to challenge yourself and see what you can get in later dungeons. You may not be able to complete later dungeons fully early on, but you can get some stuff before tackling earlier dungeons. It's all up to you if you wish to do things in order or not.\n\nOther random features include:\n- Slightly updated gameplay. Slash and diagonal movement are enabled, and a slightly wider variety of items from the standard Z1 set.\n- Z2 enemy tier system. Generally goes from Orange -> Red -> Blue, but some enemies disobey this system.\n- Secrets everywhere! Sometimes they're in obvious locations, other times they're not.\n- Heart Pieces instead of Heart Containers, just to make exploration a bit more worth it.\n- No door repairs anywhere. Bet you'll love that \n\n\n\tUPDATE LOG \n\t29/09/2019 1st Quest Update:\n- Tweaked most dungeons by adding in shortcuts and more ways to travel through dungeons. If you can find the new paths, you could even skip some keys and jump ahead a bit! Some dungeons have remained untouched.\n- Made some enemies more consistent with the colour tiers (e.g. you won't find blue octoroks in the overworld anymore, they're dark red now)\n- Gohma rooms now have at least one door open in the event of running out of rupees for the arrows. The exception is the red Gohma in Level 2 as the Hookshot can hurt it.\n- Converted all songs to .ogg format.\n- Spacebar map is now enabled for all dungeons. This should allow making dungeons a bit more manageable in case you find yourself going in loops.\n- Quest is now fully compatible with 2.53!\n- Plans for a second quest are now on the way!\n",
    "story": "The standard Zelda 1 story. Nothing different here.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- Remember that secrets are almost everywhere! Be sure to inspect as much as you can and most secrets always follow a certain kind of logic with where they are placed on the screen.- If some secrets are too hard to find, there is a Lens of Truth that is available late game so you can find those last Heart Pieces or a bit of extra money, but for a hefty price.- All dungeon rooms are shown on the map in each dungeon, so you don't need to worry about extra rooms hiding outside the map. The only exception to this is one room in Level 9, but if you remember what Z1 did, then you should be fine.- Exploration is key!",
    "credits": "Big thanks to RedmageAdam for his huge set of dungeon maps that can be found here. All dungeon map designs in this quest were taken from that collection.\n\nAlso a big thanks to my beta testers:\n- CDi-Fails\n- Lut\n- LunarRedMage\nWithout them, I probably would've ended up leaving a whole load of random bugs and some weird design choices in the quest. Also thanks to LunarRedMage for the cool bomb bag idea that I never thought of using before.\n\nAnd some music credits:\n\n- 1st Quest -\nGames:\n- Four Swords Adventures (Overworld, Levels 1 & 5)\n- Wind Waker (Levels 3 & 6)\n- Ocarina of Time (Level 8 )\n- Twilight Princess (Level 2)\n- Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky (Level 7) (thanks to CDi-Fails for suggesting this one)\n- Minish Cap (Level 4)\nSong Artists:\n- ParagonX9 (Level 9)\n\n- 2nd Quest -\nComing soon!\n\nIf I missed out anything else, please tell me!",

    "description": "Hello. This is a quest I made in 2002-2003. This version, specifically, is an update to the 2003 version that was never publicly released that had two dungeons left unfinished and lots of the overworld removed. I decided restore the missing overworld sections and make the two dungeons that were originally supposed to be in, fix a lottttt of bugs, and release it for whatever reason. I'm basically only submitting it here because I want all my finished quests to be easily available and not lost on some old webpage nobody can find.\n\nIt's not super good and it's pretty badly dated, even for a 1.92-era quest. I'd say the difficulty is somewhere between easy and moderate, with weird random spikes here and there and an overall decline in difficulty as the quest goes on, depending on how much extra equipment you find.\n\nThere's a lot more in the readme.\n\nA few other things:\n- As stated before, this quest bears no relation to the \"Legend of Zelda Ganon's Revenge\" by cousinoer5. As far as I know, both this quest and its predecessor \"Ganon's Revenge\" predate his, and the same names are a coincidence.\n- A few of you might remember this quest better as Agahnim's Revenge DX -- I attempted a reboot in like 2005. It was pretty lazy and mostly went nowhere and I never did anything past Level 2.\n- I decided when I was updating the quest to also upgrade it to 2.10. Mostly I did this because it was slightly more convenient for me to develop in, but I also went ahead and added Farore's Wind and Nayru's Love to the quest. I also decided to take advantage of Link Tile Mod and made it so that Link's hands change color when he gets gloves, similar to ALTTP.\n\nLast updated: 11/17/2017. Current version: 1.99.5.",

It was the only incarnation of the BS tileset I had handy at the time. I've since taken the liberty of carefully editing out as much as I can that belongs to him (it uses a lot of New BS tiles now), but a few concepts (notably the glowing eyes on wall decorations, although they're actually different from his tiles) remain.

The graphics are almost entirely pragmatic--there are very little actual sprites being rendered.

Making the Master Sword useless. One of the Triforces split into eight other pieces. Those eight other pieces are known as the Clocks of Courage. 2000 years later, people forgot about the Master Sword's powers. Until a crime group vowed to recover the Triforce and dismantle the Hylian Government. That group is known as the Glory Squad, and their intentions are bold, and vile. Only a hero like Link could save Hyrule from the Glory Squad. He must also recover the Triforces and get to the Master Sword before the Glory Squad does.

Melvin then finds himself in a new job, the money is nice, but it may be more challenging than he bargained for.",

    "description": "Mirage Island is a little different from other Zelda games. There is no Triforce, no Ganon, no Zelda. Instead, you have an Island. But it's a bit more complicated than that.The locations on the Island, the items you can find, and the Shrines (which are the dungeons) are randomized. In fact, you won't actually see everything in a single run (though with some options you can get close). Part of the challenge is not knowing what you'll encounter each run, and which key items will be needed to complete the different Shrines.The Shrines are a big factor in the experience. There are 4 Tiers of Shrines. Higher Tiers have stronger enemies and require more key items to complete. There is also the Elder Shrine, guarded by the Elder. To be allowed into the Elder Shrine, you must complete a random request from the Elder.As a result, you (usually) don't need to complete all the main Shrines to enter the Elder Shrine and complete the quest. The more you explore, the better geared you can be for the later Shrines.However, there are a bunch of options presented at the start of the quest, which can further change the experience of each run. Like other quests with a Randomizer, you can always use a seed to produce the same results.",
    "story": "Link and Storms do not get along. After having his Raft stuck by lightning, he finds himself on Mirage Island, a place know to exist, yet none have actually seen... or at least, have actually returned from.The Island is quite large and does have some locals. It seems like it is impossible to leave the Island, but there are several mysterious Shrines hidden all across the Island. The Islanders answer to the Elder, who watches over the Elder Shrine, the most complex and difficult Shrine on the Island. Could answers await inside? But Link has lost all his gear when he shipwrecked. And the Elder does not let anyone into the Elder Shrine who are not worthy.Now is the time to explore this strange Island, find helpful gear to combat the dangers, and solve the mysteries of the Shrines.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "This quest makes use of all the Ex buttons. You may want to set them up in the controls.L, R, Ex1, and Ex2 are used for weapon cycling.Ex3 is very useful. It pulls up a custom map of the Island to see what caves you've visited. The Island is made up of a 16 x 16 grid, split into North and South. You can move the map cursor and scroll between the two halves. You can also use A and B to change the color of the selected cave to MARK places for whatever reason you like.Ex4 displays a counter of the number of item locations of the current area, and the number checked. This does include chests that contain keys, maps, and Heart Containers from bosses.Bosses will drop a Heart Container, unless certain options make them drop Heart Pieces instead. If you want more Hearts, defeat more bosses.Some passive items will almost always appear after the boss of a Shrine. If you want to find more of these upgrades, complete more Shrines.Each shop type can appear up to 3 times. Purchasing a major item from a shop will make it disappear from any extra copies of it. You can also find caves that let you get some shop items for free, if you have not bought them yet. Save rupees by looking for the freebies first.There are also a pair of Chest Mini-games. Unlike the money making games, you pay to open each chest and keep what's inside. These chests will contain major items, so save up to open all of them. You don't need the rupees to open all of them at once though.Key items are grouped by Tier. Later Tiers require some key items from the previous Tier and potentially ALL key items from even earlier ones. It is worth exploring earlier Tiers for key items before later ones.You always start in a house. There are 16 houses on the Island. Many of these contain shops that can contain early key items.Two of the Tier I Shrines will appear in dungeon structures on the Island. This can help find the early Shrines easier.Later Shrines are more hidden. You won't find them by checking open caves.Although keys can work on any lock like in Zelda 1, the number of keys/locks per Shrine is a 1 to 1 ratio. Sometimes buying an extra key will save time, even if you are going for 100% item locations.One option for length is called Grand Tour. This makes ALL Shrines AND Elder Shrines to appear. This tends to create a very long run; it might be worth playing a few shorter runs first to get a feel for how things work.If you get stuck, the hints from the Islanders can help.Using the Ex3 Map to mark locations to return to is VERY helpful. Pick a color you like for this and stick with it.There are actually multiple endings. I suspect one of them will be very nice for a low% run.Some items will vary from run to run. Some can be used in place of key items from sequence breaks.Doing another run? The Ex Buttons set the options to a bunch of defaults. These defaults reflect a couple of scenarios: Lots of Items, Minimal Items, Closer to Z1, and All Item Locations Filled. If you want to be surprised, the MAP button randomly sets the options... but you don't know what it sets them to.You can choose the number of \"Extra Weapons\" that appear in a run. These are the last few rows of items in the inventory, and all are optional. There are a lot of different weapons you can find, and you can also control what styles of weapons appear. If you have more than 5 extra weapons, the first row of 5 is the one affected by the style option.Plays fine in 2.53, also fairly stable in 2.55",

I started work on this quest a few weeks after completing Another Land, since I had some new ideas for quests, and decided to get to work on something new. This quest actually has eight proper dungeons with Triforce pieces at the ends, so that's something to maybe look forward to. I actually tested the entire quest this time, so hopefully it should have less issues than the original Another Land did. However, if you do come across any bugs or other oddities, don't hesitate to send me a PM or use the topic I'll create.UPDATE: Fixed something in the Swamp Palace where you'd be short one key and unable to get the Bow. Hopefully.UPDATE2: Pretty big update! Fixed a bunch of bugs, added text boxes, and just generally made touch-ups here and there to hopefully enhance the experience.",
    "story": "After Link defeated Ganon in Another Land, his Wizzrobe minions were extremely angry, so after letting off some steam by destroying the mountain near Ganon's Lair, they set off to find Link. They found him rafting back to Hyrule with Zelda, so they sent them off-course, snatching Zelda up along the way. The Wizzrobes knew that Zelda's Triforce could revive anything from the dead, and they planned to use it on Ganon. Zelda, knowing this, split the Triforce up, but before she could warn Link against collecting them, she was taken to Ganon's Lair. Link saw the shards fly off to a nearby island by the name of Mirago Island, so he set off there to begin his search.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- Keep an eye out at all times. I tried not to make things cryptic, but there probably are cryptic puzzles and stuff anyway.- There's 36 Heart Pieces to grab. Not as many as the original, but still quite a bit.- Green-tinted doors in East Myragon can be blown open using Bombs. The orange door in West Myragon requires a Super Bomb to open.- Be sure that you have both the Arrow and Quiver before entering Level 2.- If you can't burn a suspicious tree down, shoot it with an arrow. If that doesn't work, slash it. If none of those work, then you either need an upgrade, or that tree can't be removed.- In Level 4, when you see objects with red on them (wall pillars, blocks, etc.), your Raft can go another direction.- After Level 5, use the Lens to locate the area's exit, against the northern wall.- Make sure you do everything you need to do before entering Level 7. You won't be able to explore the world again until after Level 8.",

Don't expect things to be very challenging or too puzzle-heavy for the most part as that is not what I was going for, it's just meant to be a simple Ages re-imagining I guess \n\nA few quest features:\n- One full overworld, with a present and past counterpart\n- 9 main dungeons... 4 of which come from Seasons and 4 come from Ages, which have the same dungeon map shapes but play out very differently, and 1 dungeon is entirely original\n- Post game story + 2 extra dungeons\n- Familiar characters/areas from Oracle of Ages\n- Fairly simplistic but hopefully easy to follow story\n\nIf you find any bugs or weird inconsistencies, be sure to let me know as soon as possible on PZC or on Discord (tag is Eddy#6814) and I'll get to fixing stuff as soon as I can. Feedback is also greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\tQuest Update Changelog (Spoilers Inside) \n\t\n15/04/18 - QUEST RELEASED\n16/04/18 - Update 1 (Minor)\n- Fixed some minor graphical errors with Level 2 and other places.\n18/04/18 - Update 2 (Minor)\n- Fixed some typos.\n- Fixed a few more graphical errors.\n24/05/18 - Update 3 (Semi-Minor)\n- Nerfed Level 9 a little in terms of enemy overcrowdedness and adjusted a couple rooms to fit difficulty a little better.\n- Fixed an oversight where you appear in the present after completing Level 8, where you're supposed to appear in the past.\n- Added some missing graphics to Super Amy when she uses the Roc's Cape.\n- Added an indicator for a specific item trigger when it's activated.\n- Fixed a couple other weird oddities and oversights.\n- Reworked the active subscreen a bit so that the Bug Causing Flute can no longer be selected with L/R, and instead you can select it when pressing down from the Drill Hammer item.

It's recommended to read through it when you're stuck as it contains many quest spoilers.- There are 2 hammer upgrades found throughout the quest, where one can only be found in the post game section of the quest. There are no defence upgrades, everything is balanced around having no rings.- In either age there is a warp zone where you can open up paths to allow for fast travel. Be sure to open up these paths along the way by entering red portals across the overworld.- The trading quest can only be accessed after the main story is completed, though you can find hints as to what NPCs want throughout the quest. Be sure to take notes of what NPCs want and where they are to make the sequence easier when you get to it. Alternatively, you can just look at the text file, but that ruins the fun - There is a specific item given as one of the post-game dungeon prizes which can break the current save file completely when used, as this is intended to be a joke item. Be sure to make a copy of the save file before using. You are warned when you collect the item too.- This quest is unpassworded. If you wish to look through the quest file for any reason like being stuck or whatever, feel free to do so, though try not to adjust anything, it would break stuff (obviously).- Have fun!",

This update doesn't have enough new features (or a new labyrinth) to justify a new version number and subtitle, but it introduces a lot of new goodies, mostly as follow ups from the official race. See below for more details. This update will break saves and requires three new songs, which can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- As Dimi won the race, his character, Victor, has been added to the game and can be selected from the character select screen. Victor's gimmick largely revolves around sacrificing HP for various boosts. His Muramasa does good damage, but if he misses with it, he'll lose HP but regain MP. Casting Thunder will give him an offensive boost but drain 3 orbs of HP over time. He also gains speed the more empty life orbs he has. But be careful: he loses defense the more enemies are on screen! He's also got a unique coin upgrade, Longer Buffs, which increases the duration of Enhance, L2 Enhance, Power Boost, and Poison.\n- Bone Zone and Mothership, two new areas which debuted in the race, now appear in the Fragmented Labyrinth.\n- Lumen, who debuted as a boss in the race, appears now as a challenge area boss, rather than a Venter Mortis boss as she was in the race.\n- Custom seeds are now supported! This file has templates and instructions on how to fill them out. No scripted knowledge is required; just fill in the blanks with the appropriate constants and you'll have a working custom seed function. Send it my way and I can have the quest updated with your seed in a matter of minutes.\n- Official Race Seed 1 is selectable from the custom seeds list (and is currently the only custom seed). As Lumen as now a challenge area boss, she's been replaced as the race's final boss by someone else.\n- Lumen and Bastille's story mode has a new cutscene.\n- Dracus and Autimecia now have subscreen dialogue.\n- LOTS of bugs have been fixed. Way too many to list, but to name some of the bigger ones people have complained about:\n--- Sixth Area B and Lake of Lighting are now properly accounted for by Fragmented logic.\n--- The snake platforms in Lac D'Amour B no longer bug out.\n--- Traps in a room will no longer cause enemies to respawn.\n--- Warp points you haven't visited will no longer randomly activate.\n\n\n11/18/2019:\nLots of little fixes and changes.\n- Hall of Watchers and Sixth Area B will now show up in the Fragmented Labyrinth correctly.\n- Giant golems that are vulnerable to weapons are now colored red, to allow easier distinction between them and the death-only golems.\n- Some continue points in Fragmented Labyrinth have been fixed.\n- You no longer have items disabled when warping to Warp Space under some circumstances.\n- Fixed a continue point with Naiya.\n- Provided better hinting at a secret in Lac D'Amour B.\n- Fixed some multiplayer crashes.\n- Fixed a bug with the warp pad orbs in Styx B.\n- Arena shutters once again work correctly.\n- Warp pad screens once again highlighted correctly on the map.\n- Addressed an issue that caused some bosses to deal no damage on relaxed mode (and two that dealt no damage with specific attacks on normal mode).\n\n11/9/2019:\n- Fixed Blink Burst not working for certain characters\n\n11/4/2019:\n- Fixed a bug that caused caused a hard ZC crash in Multiplayer in the Lake of Lightning.\n- Fixed a bug that caused Ice Skating when Mato was P2 to create odd effects.\n- Fixed a bug that allowed poison spikes to hit through Ice Skate.\n\n\n11/4/2019:\n- Fixed a bug that caused caused an infinite warp loop in Multiplayer\n\n10/13/2019:\n- Fixed a bug that caused Ice Skate to fail to activate under certain conditions.\n- Capped a certain character's magic stream damage to 1000 per hit. He's still broken, just not as broken.\n- Race seed and the winner's character will be coming soon.\n\n10/9/2019:\nFixed a bug that caused the Fragmented logic to place progression items in accessible locations.\n\n10/6/2019:\nFixed a bug that would warp you to the wrong continue point of certain screens under certain circumstances in Fragmented runs.\n\n\n9/28/2019:\n\n\tChange Log \n\t\n- Fixed a bug that allowed Eli and Desio to access a broken story mode on the Fragmented Labyrinth.\n- Disallowed F6ing around spell checks in the Fragmented Labyrinth.\n- Fixed a big that caused you to instantly warp away when continuing on certain screens with warp pads.\n\n\n9/25/2019:\n\n\tChange Log \n\t\n- Boosted the power of Flect's Wind Blade and Magic Stream from 100 to 150.\n- Disabled the freezing water message in Fragmented runs on the screen in Lethe B that is no longer freezing.\n- Fixed a bug where using certain spells would occasionally refill MP and respawn enemies.\n\n\n9/23/2019:\n\n\tChange Log \n\t\n- Fixed a bug where roaming bosses wouldn't properly spawn in certain areas on a Fragmented run.\n- Fixed a bug where Naiya's flooded areas on Fragmented runs were inconsistent.\n\n\n9/21/2019:\n\n\tChange Log \n\t\n- Fixed various minimap bugs\n- Fixed an oversight that led to stairs not working in the Hitodama Labyrinth\n- Fixed an oversight with splitting flames\n- Fixed a bug with Dracus/Autimecia's story\n- Fixed a potential soft lock situation\n\n\n9/15/2019\nIntroducing Yuurand 4.0: The Fragmented Labyrinth.

It also requires downloading new music.\n\nUpdate: Later that same night:\n- Fixed a bug that prevented using Float or Ice Skate to enter Elysium\n- Fixed a miscolored wind effect in Styx\nSorry about that, recolored the water at the last minute and apparently that was enough for Float to pitch a fit.\n\n11/11/2018:\n- Several minor bugfixes have occurred, too numerous to list, but...\n- Fixed a major bug where text didn't clear in the midpoint cutscene and didn't display in the Forgotten Void cutscene for certain characters.\n- Fixed a major bug where the roaming boss would fail to drop a spell in Poison Swamp.\n\n10/15/2018:\nIntroducing Yuurand 2.0: The Living Labyrinth! This update introduces a whole lot of new content, so see the new forum thread for full details. The key new features are listed below. Please note, This update will break saves. It also requires downloading new music.\n- A brand new labyrinth!\n- A new set of challenge areas!\n- New characters!\n- New stories!\n- New bosses!\n- Character rebalancing!\n\n9/4/2018:\nI wasn't planning on pushing this update quite yet, as it includes some planned character rebalancing but not all, but again, a pretty embarrassing bug surfaced, so... Please note, [b]This update will break saves.\n\n\tDetails \n\t\n- A oversight where weapons would sometimes be disabled after cutscenes has been fixed.\n- Zephyr's Rainy West Wind is no longer buggy. It also costs half the MP it previously did.\n- Caelan's Flame Dash takes less MP and has no cooldown. It also releases more fire, including a flame in front to make hitting fire blocks easier.\n- Xaya now takes 1.5x damage, rather than 2x damage.\n\n\n8/25/2018:\nThis is mainly to fix a pretty embarrassing oversight, but does have a nice quality of life improvement.\n\n\tDetails \n\t\n- All primaries can now reveal what item is needed to break a block. Fully charged magic stream will make icons appear just as charged sound wave does. Firing wind at the wall for about 4 seconds will also make the marker appear.\n- Thunder and primaries will now reveal the item marker regardless of damage power, fixing an oversight where low damage characters couldn't reveal the markers.\n- Holm (playable) has had his attack power buffed.\n- Ava no longer eats FFCs for breakfast, causing bosses to fail to spawn.\n- Some phantom ice blocks in Masquerade have been properly removed.\n\n\n",

The Letter, Blue Ring, two sword upgrades and five heart containers can be found in the overworld, while the rest of the special items and two bomb upgrades are in the dungeons. Secrets are not terribly obscure. Pushblocks are always multidirectional. There are only two door repair charges, but clues forewarn their location.For all that it has in common with Hyrule, Southrule is a little different. People speak faster. Hearts refill faster. Like Likes and Wall Masters move a bit quicker. And clocks do not suspend time indefinitely.",

    "description": "This quest was created based around the idea any dungeon may be done in any order, while keeping a story on the side. While this quest only features four main dungeons (and one final dungeon), each dungeon you complete will unlock various things to do (including collectibles and mini-dungeons). The dungeons in this quest aren't linear at all, so you may become a bit confused when playing them. The quest as a whole should take 4-6 hours to complete, so clearly, the quest isn't that long.\n\nUPDATE LOG:\n\nUpdate 06/11/18\n- Made it so the switches in Cragboure Castle are easily distinguishable between being pressed and not being pressed.\n- Included Item Pick-up strings for the Boss Keys.\n- Re-coloured cave entrance tiles.\n- Fixed the hitboxes of the Stones.\n- Changed song file type to .ogg.\n\nUpdate 07/11/18\n- Made it so you can enter and leave the boss key room in The Kiln without defeating the enemies.\n- Made it so you can't trap yourself in the mirror/block puzzle room in The Dry Desire.\n- Added a sound effect for each time you press a switch.\n\nUpdate 08/11/18\n- Fixed the issue in The Kiln where two tiles would be replaced by inactive spikes.\n- Replaced pots in the final corridor and other locations of The Windborne Bastion.\n- Fixed the duplication issue where the ending text repeated itself at the end of each dungeon.\n- When collecting a Stone, there is now music which plays to shorten the awkward pause.\n- More NPCs in the quest now tell you about the story and the world.\n- There are now more continue points available to the player (notably when you exit/enter important dungeons of the quest).\n- Some Zelda songs in the quest have been replaced with new ones.\n\nUpdate 09/11/18\n- Renamed all music files in order to avoid ZC confusing SC song files with other song files. (If you had already downloaded the music file, you'd need to do it again)\n- The Goron Sword is now open to you from the start, however, in order to collect it, you need five hearts.\n- The download link for the songs no longer uses Mediafire, it now uses Dropbox.\n\nUpdate 13/11/18\n- The staircase southeast of Tingle in The Kiln is now only accessible if you kill the hammer enemy and the others.\n\nUpdate 13/03/19\n- Removed the bypass on one of the puzzles in The Dry Desire, where you were able to skip the entire hookshot puzzle.\n\nUpdate 16/03/19\n- The final bosses have been slightly buffed (health increase, and their fireballs can no longer be blocked with a shield).\n\nUpdate 27/11/19\n- Updated consistency issues with the Shovel and quicksand.\n- Removed some Bombchus from Goron Settlement to prevent unavoidable damage.\n- Made it easier to find the Bucket, which starts the Trade Sequence - Minor adjustments made to the drop rate.\n- Changed the trap room in The Tumulus.\n- Added a shortcut skipping the trap room in the Tumulus.\n- Added secret sound effects for switches in Cragboure Castle.",

On his journey, he would meet various people and acquire various pieces of equipment.The Deities are worshipped by the Mortals, and so his sisters know not to send him as himself to the Kingdom, and the Mortals would easily recognise him. The sisters decide that, with the influence of the Mortal leaders, he should take the body of any random Mortal, and accomplish his goal in that form. The challenges for the Stones were designed to keep Mortals out, so now the brother must be careful when collecting the Stones.It is up to you to choose what to do first, and only you can ensure he accomplishes his destiny.",

The game is about 25 hours play and about 3 times the size of the original Zelda.The game is in old school SNES style and almost no scripted stuff. However, its highly customized in every way.Lots of custom graphics and enemies. More than 5 villages, 20+ caves or dungeons and over 2 different overworld maps. Massive amounts of weapons, enemies and things to search for.Not so many puzzles and riddles more pure fighting and go look for things, but there are a lot of stories and some cutscenes and a few major plot twists...Later 2020 an extended version will be avalible.",

The game is pretty dull visually, since when I started making the quest I was very new to ZC, so it onlyuses the vanilla tile set, but I tried to be as creative as possible with it to convey different areas with a unique flair, making every screen as memorable as my skill allowedme to. There's also nothing game changing about the gameplay; classic items, find the dungeon, beat the dungeon, repeat. It's the first quest I put any real effort into, andthat effort was put entirely into making the game - decent. It may not blow your socks off, but I hope you have a bit of fun with it nonetheless.",

Link tried to stop him, but was knocked unconscious by the MasterWizzrobe. Using Luke's blood, and the Triforce of Wisdom of Princess Zelda, who was held captive in the Dark Fortress,Ganon was revived. Luke was then cursed to be the guard who kept Zelda imprisoned.By the light of the Triforce of Courage, Link woke up and headed to Hyrule, where his journey to defeat Ganon and his brotherbegins, in a familiar green area.",

It sticks to the Zelda 1 style, but now with nearly everything from previous quests combined with new features.For those unfamiliar, a Randomizer takes a base world, and shuffles things like items around, so you don't know what you'll find where. Randomizers often come with an option to enter a seed, which will produce the same results if entered the same. This randomizes both where each cave goes on an overworld, and item locations. In addition, there are options to vary the length. There are multiple overworlds you can start in, and searching around will find warps between them.Although the overworlds and dungeons may be Zelda 1 styled, there area lot of quality of life features that make it feel much more advanced. Compasses give a tone if killing all enemies drops an important item. You can track where each cave goes on the overworld, and also see progress on collecting all items in the current area. A Fortune Teller can reveal important locations like dungeons on the map, but you'll need to keep paying to reveal more. Secrets are far more obvious than those in Zelda 1. Dungeon doors are custom, removing issues like suction from bombed walls, and fake walls expect Lens of Truth to find them.There are up to 4 Owerworlds and 16 sets of 9 dungeons. Options can control how many overworlds you can travel between, the number of dungeon sets located in each, and how the dungeons are placed and distributed between the worlds. There are even a few options to generate a world similar to past randomizers.There are hundreds of items you can obtain. The actual total number of items varies from length or options regarding Heart Pieces, but you can have a total over 500.Each overworld has its own set of Triforce Pieces linked to it, and all Level 9s in that world need all 8 of those pieces to enter. You will only find those pieces in the world they belong in, traveling to different worlds will reveal different pieces.The final goal is to defeat Ganon and rescue Zelda. His true location is unknown, but looking around and clearing those Level 9s may give the clues needed to find him.",
    "story": "Ganon has taken Zelda to his Tower, you need to rescue her. However, you don't know what to expect along the way. Not even the world you come from stays the same. Perhaps by overcoming countless monsters, rupee stealing Old Men, hungry Goriyas, lazy toll-keeping minions, and Ganon's best minions, will you reach your goal.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "A lot of the clues given by NPCs can be useful. On a first play, you may want to keep those hints normal, and read them all.The Ex 3 and 4 buttons bring up some special menus. The map shows where all the caves in the current overworld go, and you can use A and B to change the color of them, for a personalized tracking system. The weapon menu lets you pick which 18 items can be cycled between in the normal inventory, and some special weapons come in multiple variations that you can switch between in this menu. You can also do a sort to pick the 18 highest leveled weapons owned, and even choose to sort based on their type.If you choose to play with multiple overworlds, pay attention to which one you start in. Not only will you restart here if you save in quit in any overworld, but a lot of useful early items, plus something else important, will appear in this world. You will need to explore other worlds, and sooner depending on the difficulty chosen.Enemies get more difficult as the level number increases. It is worth sticking to the early levels for a while until you have a lot of useful exploration items, a decent weapon, and some more life before doing the late ones.Once you know where the true Final Dungeon is, note you can get there really early, without completing a single level 9.In the starting cave, you can toggle if items have a description when picked up. You can also use the training dummy to test the strength of the weapons you've got.All Pols Voice have a secret weakness. It is never the Sword or Sword Beams, those just do normal damage.Every overworld has a cave where you can get one of those major shop items for free. You may want to find this before buying out every shop.In very long lengths, you may encounter P Bags. These just give you rupees and ammo, as there are more locations for items to appear than the total items.I totally wouldn't drop multiple hints about bonus content. Not at all.",

The cutscenes are fairly front and back-loaded, so expect to be wowed at the start, and then the middle of the game to be primarily just be gameplay. The last part of the game, however, including all of Ganon's Fortress, is heavily loaded with story, cutscenes, characters and weirdness.\n\nCutscenes feature animated portraits, all drawn by me. Some are larger and more detailed than others, or they change as the game goes on for story reasons. Oh, except Din. Din isn't animated. Din is a statue.\n\nThis quest is very hard. I designed it for my friends to play, and they are quite good at this sort of game, and I wanted it to be a challenge for them. If you can't beat it, I'm sorry. \n\n7/31/19: Fixed accidental Ganon death, Bro Guy lying about Manhandlas, World Pillar 5 stuck glitch, Golden Pyramid 'sort of stuck' glitch, and Ruined Hyrule stuck glitch.\n\n5/17/20: Fixed item placement bugs where enemy held items would spawn in walls if not picked up before leaving room.

He is completely bonkers. His goal is to defeat Ganon and take over the forces of evil for himself. Two other Wizzrobes touched the Triforce of Courage and Wisdom, and they too are awakened and free of Ganon. They are also... abnormal... and possibly Dutch. They are ostensibly your allies.\n\nGanon attacked Link and Zelda in the middle of their wedding! Link is missing, and Zelda has been kidnapped by Ganon's forces (although not after killing an alarmingly large number of them.). Wizzrobes ain't give a damn, though. They just want power, Zelda means very little to them one way or the other.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "1. If you skip or ignore dialogue, you will likely end up not knowing what to do or unable to beat a boss. Characters say important gameplay-related things.\n\n2. All secrets that are better than rupees are indicated in some way. A bush standing on its own; the only flat rock surface on the screen; other unique terrain features; dialogue hints. If you go burning every non-descript bush and bombing every wall, you will find rupees, but that is probably all.\n\n3. If something is way too hard, you might be there too early, or there might be items you haven't found yet outside of whatever dungeon you're delving.\n\n4. Some dungeons have multiple entrances.\n\n5. All keese and bats drop huge amounts of magic. Bats = magic. Magic = bats. Bagic = mats.\n\n6. There are some very weird and very out of the way secrets placed in unorthodox ways. The more completely bizarre a secret is, the less likely it has something really important to find. So if you miss them, you're probably only missing a weird joke or funny scene. If you actually find the faerie, for example, no, she doesn't drop anything. It's not a bug. It's just a silly event.\n\n\n\n7. Translating the Dutch won't reveal any important gameplay secrets. If you're not actually Dutch, even translating it won't help that much in understanding. It's very slang-ridden, and everything Dutch Guy says is... very weird.\n\n8. There are two endings. If you beat the game and you are super depressed and ready to cry, you got the bad ending. But the good ending is still possible to reach if you reload! Just... think about a better way to do what you just did?\n\n9. Download the music. Jokes will fall completely flat without it.",

If you're a player with a brain that doesn't require you to do that, well hats off to you. If you're like me however, and don't have a super sticky memory but you don't happen to enjoy jotting down where some passages lead to or walls you've tried bombing, this quest may not be for you - just sayin'.",

    "description": "The Depths of Malice is a modern-ish, classic-ish, NES-style-ish dungeon romper created for the 6th Quest Contest over a four month period. It's about the closest thing to a classic style quest you'll get from me, though how classic it is is up for some amount of debate. It seeks to celebrate ZC's legacy by invoking an old-school vibe while pushing the limits of what 2.53 is capable of with new ideas and features.\n\nSo what can you expect from The Depths of Malice?Two 16x8 overworlds, one based on Zelda 1 and one completely original.Nine dungeons, two of which are freeform, and all of which feature new scripted gimmicks and bosses.A mix of new and returning items.Nonlinearity, with the ability to tackle several dungeons \"out of order\".An HP system which allows you to survive mortal damage by collecting health before your HP meter drains.Scary Lynels.An engaging story set in the Zelda universe but divorced from typical Zelda themes.An extra game mode, unlockable upon clearing the quest, for added replayability.\nFor the best experience, please play in the newest 2.53.1 beta from ZC's download page. While the quest should run fine in earlier versions of 2.53, or even (probably) 2.50, you may experience some minor compatibility bugs, such as annoyances with picking up items with melee weapons.\n\nUpdates: 3/15/20\n- Fixed a bug that could cause the Lost Hills path to break if you obtained a certain item upgrade.\n\n\n\tOlder updates \n\t2/29/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Added a wallet upgrade to the OW, per popular demand.\n- Added two new late-game item upgrades, both of which require finding hidden entrances to late-game dungeons. Abei hints at these.\n- Ensured that every dungeon has at least two (three in the case of The Tower) bomb/rupee drops.\n- Added a new option to a certain game mode that utilizes these new drop locations.\n- Added a seed display to the subscreen in a certain game mode.\n- Fixed a bug (for real this time) where defense values lower than 50 would display incorrectly on Hard or Insane.\n- Fixed a minor bug where you would swim more slowly underneath leafy overhangs in the Northern Sea.\n- Fixed some misc script errors.\n- Fixed a bug where a warp from a cave was set to scrolling warp, rather than insta warp.\n- Fixed a logic bug that could place arrows behind a soft arrow check.\n- Fixed a bug where collecting an arrow upgrade would un-equip arrows.\n- Fixed a bug where the wrong item could appear in The Tower's item cellar.\n\nThis update may break older saves, so use caution when updating!\n\n2/27/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a logic bug with a certain game mode.\n- Added healing tiles outside the final boss room.\n\n\n2/20/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a bug where stats could, in rare occasions, become 0.\n- Upped the stat total in a certain mode from 300 to 320.\n- Wand fire now properly lights the torches in Depths of the Abyss.\n- Wand fire is no longer nearly as finnicky about burning OW secrets.\n- Fixed a version compatibility bug where melee weapons would drop flames after obtaining the book on 2.50 versions.\n- Exploding Jellyfish no longer lose their collision when struck by a boomerang.\n- Easy and Relaxed modes are now easier, with defense buffs from normal increase from 50% to 75% on easy, and 100% to 150% on Relaxed.\n- A frequently missed bomb wall in Coral Caverns is now better hinted at.\n- A tablet at the beginning of Coral Caverns clarifies that you are not expected to tank to reach keys now.\n- Fish orbs now make the proper sound effect when struck by an arrow while inactive.\n- Misc typos are now fixed.\n\n\n2/7/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a bug with yesterday's update that caused stats to sometimes become negative.\n- Fixed some inconsistencies that could occur in a particular game mode.\n- Fixed a soft lock in Level 7.\n- Replaced the exploding jellyfish in an alloy cave with enemies that don't sometimes have a stroke and print script errors when particular items are obtained.\n\n\n2/6/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a bug that caused potions to heal for far less than they should.\n- Shops will no longer sell elixers when you already have a potion.\n- In a certain mode, stats should be more balanced, rather than always weighted towards speed and away from defense.\n\n\n2/4/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a critical bug which caused the ending to fail to play if you dealt the final blow to the final boss with an ice projectile\n- Removed an Armos that inadvertently wound up in the Lost Hills in a past update.\n\n\n2/3/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Transition from the Northern Sea to a slow swim area will no longer cause you to rebound out or move in strange directions.\n- A softlock that could occur in the push block alloy room has been fixed.\n- A rare softlock that could occur in Level 1 under special circumstances has been fixed.\n- Level 3's boss now has a long delay following it's vulnerability period where it has no hitbox and cannot attack.\n- Level 4's boss's projectiles now properly deal damage.\n- The Ward Spell has a pickup message now.\n- The tablet in L3 now properly freezes action.\n- An odd bug that caused floor tiles to be pushable in one screen under specific circumstances has been corrected.\n- Misc misaligns fixed.\n- Two script errors were fixed.\n\n\n1/31/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Moving in and out of water should no longer have an annoying delay.\n- Fixed a few places where you could get yourself stuck with item usage.\n- Abei no longer hints at melee weapon upgrades before you can reach them.\n- Wand should knock enemies back in the proper direction now.\n- Fires should no longer fail to burn groups of bushes or coral.\n- Shop items you've already purchased no longer display for one frame on screen entry.\n- The grave scene will no longer play if you failed to view it before completing level four and returning to the shrine.\n- A few misc script errors were fixed, for those of you who play with the console open.\n\n\n1/28/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a bug with the Lost Hills.\n- Fixed a minor sequence break in Level 2.\n- Splitting jellyfish will now be stunned after splitting if stunned while split.\n- Splitting jellyfish now drop bombs much more frequently.\n- The smallest splitting jellyfish are now killed by the boomerang and hookshot.\n- The Level 3 boss has been nerfed; summons die in one hit and drop more arrows, spikes come up less frequently on normal or below, and the homing swarms now wait before homing.\n- Minor change made to shop dialogue.\n\n\n1/26/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Abei no longer gives hints for shrines you've already cleared.\n- Changed minimaps to be consistent; a grid is now displayed for any OW or cave screen.\n- Fixed minor problem with overhead transparency in the Shrine door.\n- Minor walkability error fixed.\n- Misc typo fixes.\n- Lut is now properly credited.\n- Removed an unused song that was accidentally included in the download folder.\n\n\n1/25/20\n\n\tChangelog \n\t- Fixed a bug that could cause the bridge to the boss room in L2 to be solid.\n- Fixed a bug that could cause Lynel drops to become unonbtainable.\n- Fixed some solidity issues in Suspended Reef.\n- Fixed a misalign in L6.\n- Fixed a bug that allowed you to walk out of bounds on one screen.\n- Recolored an oddly-colored seafoam on one screen.\n- Made Abei's hint to L2's location a little more clear.\n- Various typo corrections.\n\n",
    "story": "Two hundred years have passed since the ocean waters entombed Hyrule, the final victim of the mad Gerudo king. Distrust spreads through the public, as rumors of the rise of a new Gerudo king spread. A curse rises from the ocean waters, with thick smoke choking any who would seek to dive to the ruins of Hyrule below and strange creatures stalking the towns at night. After receiving a call for help intended for his late mother, the young Zora prince Kell travels to the Northern Sea to help. With the Zora's Sapphire to protect him, he descends below the waves, seeking answers and a means to dispel the curse. But things are not as they seem, and he quickly finds himself entangled in an ancient conflict far different from what he was expecting.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Bombable walls are a fairly frequent occurrence. Their locations are often hinted by the map, room layout, or general dungeon flow.There are no walk-through walls, and you are never expected to bomb off the map.Explore the world carefully; each dungeon item opens the way to least two heart containers and one magical alloy.Sneaking past Lynels, or just running, may be more viable than fighting them early on. If you decided to fight, there's no shame in kiting them into a more manageable arena.",
    "credits": "A full list of credits can be viewed upon clearing the quest.However, I wish to recognize a few people who greatly contributed here. Moosh's help cannot be understated. He provided the Hookshot 2 tileset upon which this quest was built and created all the dungeon palettes and several overworld palettes for me, based off my sometimes difficult descriptions. He also made sprites for the main characters and offered several ideas which ended up becoming incorporated into the quest. In a similar vein, Aevin contributed several ideas to the quest, as well as the subscreen and underwater overlay effects. At several points along the way, he also served as a well of emotional support to help pull me through this process. Finally, I'd like to thank Zoria for running the contest which spawned this quest in the first place, as well as all the other contest entrants, whose work helped inspire and motivate me these last few months.",

    "description": "A sort of \"what if\" 6th quest, with a very simplistic NES-style story and many faithful elements to Zelda 1, but with totally new items, different behaviors for familiar enemies, a mirrored overworld, and a twisted new form of familiar dungeon design and caves.\n \nAlthough very Zelda 1-based and with a few cryptic elements of NES style design, there are also much more complex puzzles involving new items that could not appear in Zelda 1 (although this quest is nowhere near as complex as Link and Zelda: Panoply of Calatia, and is meant to be more approachable and simple than that.)\n \nAn optional Mode Menu (press the Map button) allows you to change the game's entire presentation, such as how the game scrolls, whether the player can move in Zelda 1 four-way style or eight-way diagonal movement, the difficulty of monsters, the ability to attack with the mouse, what music is playing, how advanced the graphics colors are, custom character costumes, and more!

    "story": "Moments after the events in \"The Legend of Zelda\", Link is captured by Mirror Gannon and taken to Mirror Hyrule, along with the Triforce of Power which has been broken into eight large pieces.\n\nIn Mirror Hyrule, everything is familiar, but nothing is quite the same. Princess Zelda must seek the help of strange creatures and unfamiliar items to navigate this reversed world and it's mysteriously intertwined underworld. Is Zelda's wisdom enough to overcome these strange puzzles and save Link... or is she headed straight into a fiendish trap?",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Each time you continue the game on the overworld, Impa will tell you a hint in the Debug Console window. These hints cycle through 11 possible hints (before cycling back to the first), and those 11 each update if you've obtained certain items or made certain progress. If you're stuck, you can try F6ing a few times to see what all her current hints are. This isn't required, but can help if you have no idea what to do.\n\nAlthough knowledge of Zelda 1 is not required to beat this game, it is helpful, since there is a Z1-style minimum of explanatory text within the game, and many patterns may look more familiar if you know Z1 well. While this quest has item and puzzle elements more akin to the Gameboy Zelda games, this is overall very much a Zelda 1 fangame.\n\nDead ends are almost never just dead ends, especially if you had to use a key or do something special to get into them. Explore in detail before you backtrack.\n\nZelda 1 pushblock logic is in effect. You may need to kill enemies in the room to push a block. You may need to push any block on the screen, although this generally only happens on screens with a few blocks. A certain item you get early on may make it easier to determine which blocks you DON'T need to push, and find the ones you do.\n\nNothing in the Mode Menu is required, although it can be helpful. Think of the Mode Menu as a sort of breaking of the fourth wall, to adjust the game to your own comfort and enjoyment- whatever makes the game more enjoyable for you is what you should pick.\n\nYou can save a lot of time by using the \"Save Here\" option on the mode menu very often, and thinking about where you want to continue from when you're at the overworld's continue screen since it can take you to dungeon entrances you've visited.\n\nIf there are strange spots on the ground, there's a good chance something is hidden in that area.\n\nThere are 9 dungeons in this quest. The first three are \"Level A\", and can completed in any order. You must complete all three Level As to get through levels 4-6, which are \"Level B\". After that comes two dungeons of \"Level C\", and the final dungeon is \"Level D\". If you are absolutely stuck finding these dungeons and can't figure out a way in, it might be helpful to...\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t...look up a map of where dungeon entrances are in Zelda 1's first quest, then consider the shapes of the dungeons you've been to.\n\n\nTo play the Randomizer mode (this code is also revealed at the end of the quest):\n\n\tSpoiler \n\tHold EX2, R, and Start during the beginning intro scenes.\n",

    "description": "The clock is ticking! Can you solve this quest before your time runs out? If you don't, you will be warped back to the beginning! But you will be wiser with newly acquired knowledge, and will steadily get closer to your goal!\n\nThe whole quest is like a single big puzzle, which you have to solve under a time limit. Many actions will also make the clock tick faster, so after getting acquainted with the game world during your first runs, you will have to plan your moves and find the optimal ways to do things. There are often alternate solutions to solve the puzzles, but some are more efficient than others. \n\nYou have to start over after your time runs out (or after you die in a boss fight), but thanks to the clues and knowledge acquired during each run, you will be steadily figuring more things out and making progress towards the ultimate goal. Be aware that, among real clues, you may also find red herrings that will only waste your time! Can you figure out what is a useful clue, and what isn't?\n\nThe expected gametime to beat the quest is about two hours as long as you don't get too badly stumped. For completists, there is also a totally optional and cryptic meta puzzle hidden in there.\n\nYour quest file is saved at the end of each run (since the quest does actually remember some of your progress), so make sure not to quit in the middle of a run if you feel progress has been made.\n\nWORD OF WARNING: Because of the nature of this quest, is it very easily spoilable, so you should not watch a stream of it if you intend to play it later on. Similarly, I'd like to ask to any potential streamers to warn their viewers about this beforehand ",

Items and features not seen in Zelda 1 are put to use here!\n4. A few unexpected twists here and there to the formula.\n5. Charming old ladies and rude shopkeepers.\n6. A fully predictable and lackluster final boss.\n7. A good selection of NSF music made/ported by a wide variety of talented authors! The NSF files included should have the proper credits embedded in them!\n8. A good time!\n\nWhat you probably shouldn't expect:\n1. Many scripted features.\n2. The ladder (I don't actually remember if I put it in, but I'd imagine not).\n\n\nA short thing to note: I recall there being some minor bugs with overworld return points on screen or two that I may or may not have ever fixed, if you find any, please shoot me a DM or something.\n\n*1: Quest is not actually new, it was finished in december of 2016, so it's a good few years old by now. It just never got uploaded to pure before, so it's effectively new for most people!\n\n\nUpdate 1.1 Changes:\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t1. Changed animation style on link to BS Zelda.\n2. Added a shop that sells an optional costume if you don't want to play as link.\n3. Some small colour tweaks on a few things (hopefully didn't break anything...)\n",

    "description": "This quest is a direct sequel to Legend of Lana, but it's also a very unforgiving action RPG! Your character will grow as you kill enemies and how they grows will vary slightly depending on what tools you use to fight. Mana regain goes up if you use magic weapons, you learn more technical combat moves if you use physical weapons, etc. You're expected to play carefully and manage combat encounters in thoughtful manners, especially in the early to mid game, late game can be a bit different depending on your character growth.The quest is decently sized with the dungeon being around 12 floors of varying sizes, some backtracking is encouraged at times, there are also a few optional areas that might be worth your time. It's hard to measure exact playtime for the quest, but I'd expect *at least* 4-5 hours on a first casual playthrough, and that's factoring in a few deaths.The quest originally started as a contest entry for a 2 week contest years ago, but it was later finished back in 2017, and now, it's finally avalible on PureZC for you to enjoy!",
    "story": "The world tree is decaying as a result of Lana's/Cia's messing with time during the events in Hyrule Warriors, if it dies that could spell the end of the world so Lana sets out to see if she can fix it..., of course, she might not be very popular there...",

Despite there being a lot of forest the map still remains diverse.You'll find nine dungeon that progress in difficulty and complexity as you play through.

This is my first quest that took me about a month or so (breaks included) to finish, and I hope you like it. Please give me feedback, let me know what I should and shouldn't do in my next quest, what I should try, what I should do again, etc...This quest contains eight main dungeons ranging from small to large, as well as a final dungeon and 5 mini dungeons, as well as a few \"custom\" bosses.WARNING: Contains some potentially tedious block puzzles, but they shouldn't be too bad.This should be a 16 heart quest.Edit: Fixed various problems mentioned by user Luet, as well as the pit outside Level 4.",

When he left, he broke the Triforce of Courage into 8 pieces in case something happened to him or Hyrule.A year after his father's departure, Link jr had a dream of Ganon's minions getting revenge on Hyrule, so he decided to seek out the Triforce of Courage and use it to enter the fortress of Oga'lona, Ganon's lieutenant who was hiding near North Castle Town.",

    "description": "Hyrule's Awakening is a very experimental, proof-of-concept quest. In it's simplest, it's just a remake of Z1 in the GB style, but it's much more than that. It uses many scripts to make it feel as close to GB Zeldas as possible. Now, this could all have been even better, but keep in mind this was the best I could do with existing scripts I could find, since I can't script anything myself.The main focus when creating this was to not make the best possible quest out there, but to just show you that GB-sized screens are somewhat possible in ZC, and also show my vision of a Zelda 1 remake in Link's Awakening style. Also, one could see this as my love letter to the Game Boy/GB Color, Link's Awakening and Zelda 1!~FEATURES~- The dungeon layouts, overworld areas and base screens are all based on the original Zelda 1st Quest, but everything has been remade in Link's Awakening style, trying to match that style as closely as possible.- The dungeons are completely different from Z1's aside from their layout. The dungeons are much closer to Link's Awakening's dungeons actually.- GB-SIZED SCREENS! This is all thanks to Avaro's Scrollwarping Doors script in the database. The screens are now the same size as they would be in Link's Awakening/Oracles. The subscreen, sadly I couldn't move so it would be connected to the screens sadly, since I can't script anything myself, and it would have required a completely customly scripted subscreen to work.- Items are more based on Link's Awakening, so you'll see stuff like the Roc's Feather or an equippable Power Bracelet.- Scripted bosses and enemies; many enemies from Link's Awakening have been recreated for this, and all the bosses are custom (aside from one Patra, and some minibosses).- 2 simple trading sequences.UPDATE 1:- Removed the possibility of running into a softlock in Level 5- Added one extra key to Level 3 to prevent a hardlock- Adjusted one overworld screen to, once again, fix a potential softlock",

    "description": "What started as a simple remake has evolved into something completely different, I present \"Legend of Link: The New Legacy\". I abandoned this project back in 2017 or so and then decided to revisit it last year May. About a year later, it's finally finished and I'm glad this is finally out.\n\nExplore the land of Hyrule in a completely open ended world on the quest to save Zelda from Ganon. Almost everything has been revamped and redesigned entirely from the original quest. Along the way you'll find many smaller quests and cool activities to do while you go out on your adventure.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you want to play the original quest for comparison, you can do so here.\n\nI hope you enjoy the quest!\n\n\n\tUPDATE LOG \n\t\n25/07/2021\n- Quest Released\n25/07/2021\n- Immediately fixed a bug in the intro sequence. Lol that was fast\n08/09/2021\n- Fixed two permastuck situations in the Frosted Peak\n- Added a hint NPC regarding the dungeon difficulties\n- Fixed a few minor bugs here and there and a softlock in Litora Ruins\n21/10/2021\n- Fixed yet another permastuck situation in the Frosted Peak\n",
    "story": "The small town of Nodnol Village hosts a rafting competition once every year. This is a very special occasion as this marks the 20th anniversary of the contest, so Zelda, the Princess of Hyrule, decides to visit the village to see this event for herself. Link, a young village boy, also happens to be participating this year. Things all go well until something bad happens when the competition is over, a certail evil has returned once again. Join Link as he goes to rescue Zelda in a very familiar, yet very different land of Hyrule.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- In the quest download, there's a spoiler text file for all the Heart Pieces, Magic Containers and other collectables. Be sure to use it if you get stuck anywhere.- This quest is completely open ended, meaning that you can do any dungeon in any order.- Although depending on which dungeons you choose to enter first, this may affect the difficulty of others so keep that in mind. Dungeon difficulty is usually indicated by the colours of the statues at the entrance of every dungeon (Silver = Easy, Red = Hard), and these are determined when you enter your first few dungeons.- If you are having trouble with a dungeon and feel underpowered, leave and come back later with better gear or try to go for the dungeon item and then leave. This is once again very dependent on the route you take.- There is a short postgame after you beat the main quest.- If you need any help, be sure to ask in the help thread on the forums. This quest is unpassworded though, so if you really want to you can look through the quest yourself for help, but be warned that you'll most likely get spoiled for stuff.",
    "credits": "See the \"Quest Credits\" text file in the quest download for actual credits, there's quite a lot to list.

Please read the non-spoiler section of the Tips and Tricks section of the page if you are new to kaizo-esque design.\n\nAlthough the origins of this quest are largely silly, I wanted to make a serious attempt at what I honestly think is a seriously underappreciated genre in the ZC community, due to the toxicity surrounding discourse around it: Challenge/Kaizo/Type B quests. I wanted to showcase the potential such a genre has when taken seriously, and as a result, this quest is much easier than the usual challenge quest. I've tried to minimize RNG as much as I can, and the only real points where there are RNG are largely intentional as I either thought it was actually fun in those spots, or by making it simple to mitigate.\n\nI'd like for this quest to largely be a motivator for other people to try their hand at this kind of design. It's niche, but I think there's serious potential in these types of quests that's largely untapped.\n\nFeatures:\n- 5 dungeons.\n- 4 items (Excluding the sword)\n- 7 total hearts\n\nThis type of quest isn't for everyone, but I do encourage you to give this is a try if you want to get into this genre. Please do give feedback as well, suggestions to mitigate any tedious parts of the game are appreciated.",

Being weaker, they split the Triforce into 4 pieces instead of 8.With new tactics under their belt, however, they're able to render Link defenseless, and so, Link sets off on perhaps one of his most perilous journeys against the remnants of the dark king.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Generally speaking, most dead ends are kill all enemy rooms. Most other enemies are intended to either be ignored or avoided.LEARN YOUR HITBOXES AND EXPLOITS. For example: The Hammer extends ever so slightly farther to the right than it does the left when aiming to hammer pegs down. 0 damage weapons stun enemies, etc..As opposed to the usual type B quest, F6ing is not only allowed, but should be actively used as a tool you, the player, have under your belt.Death Knights have a high heart drop rate. If you are next to a room with one, consider using them to heal up.If you wish to figure out the gimmick for level 2 yourself, don't read this spoiler, but if you can't be bothered by my vague design, go ahead and read here:\n\tSpoiler \n\tMaze paths are visually indicated, and you're supposed to be able to figure them out by looking around carefully.

Also fixed up the enemy screen to include \"Wizards\" and \"Pabbits\", and gave \"Wizards\" long-range fire instead of short range, to make them harder.)\n\n\n--- Title Screen / inserting coins ---\n\nBefore starting the game, you must insert one or more coins (press start). The machine can accept up to 4 coins at once, after which it will return any more coins you try to insert.\n\n(If you enable the \"Free Play\" dipswitch by pressing EX1, the arcade machine will not require any coins to play.)\n\nIf you wait on the title screen, a demo animation will play.\n\n \n--- How to play ---\n\nThis game is composed of random dungeon passageway screens with simple challenges. On every 9th level, you must battle Gannon to rescue the Princess. Each time you play, the stages appear in a different order.\n\nYou only have 3 hearts; each time you are hit you'll lose 1 heart. and at 0 he will lose a life. You will also lose a life if the Timer reaches 0. The game is over when you are out of lives.\n\nAny time you quit the game, it will start over; you must get a Game Over for the game to save your high score. If you shut off the arcade cabinet early it will not save a new high score.\n\nFor each 10,000 points, you will gain a 1-up. Rescuing Princess Zelda will also give you a 1-up and fill your hearts. You start with 3 lives, and can have up to 9. (Heart Containers weren't invented until Super Zelda Legend on the Nintendo Family Computer.)\n\n \n--- Powerups ---\n\nSword: Swordman starts with a sword, but if he finds a better sword, he will turn blue and be able to fire Sword Beams until he takes a hit.\n\nBomb: Replaces the sword until the end of the level and turns Swordman red. Kaboom!\n\nClock: Adds more time to the timer.\n\nHeart: Refills one of Swordman's life hearts. Certain special hearts can fill all three hearts.\n\nGold: A mysterious golden triangle that makes Swordman temporarily invincible, and he will defeat any enemy he touches.\n\n\n\n--- Bonus modes ---\n\nIf you gain over 100,000 points, certain helpful items will stop reappearing in certain levels.\n \n\"Zelda Edition\":\nIn the alternate timeline 1998, a \"Zelda Edition\" IPS romhack was released which swapped the roles of Swordman (\"Prince Link\", named after later games such as Super Zelda Legend on the Nintendo Family Computer) and Zelda (\"Swordgirl\"). You can apply \"Zelda Edition\" by pressing EX2.\n \nHero Mode A:\nWhen you reach Level 64, the stages will begin to repeat in a new random order, but the enemies will turn blue and have twice as much HP. Gannon will not increase his HP, but he becomes immune to swordbeams, and his attacks will become twice as strong (and the statues in the corners of the room will always spawn 1 keke bat). You can enable the Hero Mode dipswitch at the start of the game by pressing EX3, but that's not recommended for a first time playthrough.\n \nHero Mode B:\nIf you reach Level 128, enemies will attack twice as hard, and Gannon will increase his HP. This is the hardest mode, and you can enable it by pressing the EX3 dipswitch twice. Good luck!\n \n???:\nIt's rumored that something strange happens if you reach level 256, maybe a glitch, and they say the effect ends at level 512. Developer Miyahon did not claim to know about anything special happening at level 256. In any case, playing for that long is boring and not recommended.\n \nCrash the arcade machine:\nAt level 1024, the game will reach a \"kill screen\" and become unplayable. Playing for that long is absolutely not recommended.",

    "tipsAndCheats": "If you enable any of ZC's cheat modes, during the levels you can press EX1 to gain a 1-up, EX4 to instantly win the current level, hold EX2 to increase the level number, and hold EX3 to increase the score.\n\nLevel 1 cheat code:\n\n\tSpoiler \n\tzelda\n\nLevel 2 cheat code:\n\n\tSpoiler \n\tBillyMitchell\n\nLevel 3 cheat code:\n\n\tSpoiler \n\tBillyMays\n\nLevel 4 cheat code:\n\n\tSpoiler \n\t4\n\n\nIf you press EX4 on the title screen, you will enable the \"Infinite Lives\" dipswitch. This also enables pressing EX4 during the level to instantly win that level.",

Knight, wizard, monk, or thief (Link's decision 1 2007 only had the first two). Each will get a different set of items based on the class's two common abilities: offense, defense, magic, trickery. No matter which you choose, you'll only be able to reach six out of twelve class dungeons, but you can see all in two playthroughs if (in-game information).This v2.10 quest was almost entirely built while 2.50 was in beta. A lost version was recovered last year and finished fully in v2.10.This quest is meant to be played in the latest ZC version. All testing was done with v2.53.",

Fortunately, Link doesn't seem to ever need to know what's going on to succeed.A southern province of Calatia has been under attack. Ganon has somehow managed to sneak into the King's Bunker, which is only able to opened for Calatia's king and queen. Whether Ganon found a way in or was somehow spawned inside doesn't matter, there's no way the King would want to visit the bunker now. So, Ganon thinks that he has a permanent foothold, and everybody assumes Ganon could never be driven out.A hero who could collect all six ancient relics will have proven themselves worthy to enter in the king's place. To do so, Link will have to travel centuries in the past, and also centuries in the future.(There's a little more on the quest's site.)",

There is even a set of overworld maps where you choose which level you are on and it censors out all the screens you can't get to, a set of overworld minimaps if you need to know where the dungeons are but don't want to see the screens, and a HC and MC checklist.\n\nQuest's site is here.",
