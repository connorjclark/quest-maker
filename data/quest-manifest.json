    "description": "Dragon Legend of Zelda: Unification is a quest full of puzzles and secrets that will take some thinking to get through. Features that are usually not in BS Quests have shown up in here including a hookshot, Lens of Truth, Golden Arrows, and more! Also, a warning to beginners. It's recommended you play a few other quests to learn the feel of ZC before playing this quest, as it does assume you have experience.\n\nUPDATES:\n\nThe updated version is just named unification.qst in the zip file. But I'm also bundling the original non-modified release in here as unification-original.qst. Only play that version if you don't want any of the updates listed below. Both versions were still created in 1.90.\n \nUPDATE 1.0.2 (7/29/2014):\n\n1. Hopefully fixed a dead end in level 8 that forced you to do a continue warp.\n2. Fixed a block \"puzzle\" in level 2 that would trap you in a block and force you to do a continue warp if you came into the room at the wrong direction.\n3. Hopefully fixed all instances where I used cancel warps so that later ZC versions don't randomly have wavy warps that go nowhere. If you still find some of these, please let me know.\n\nUPDATE 1.0.1 (7/24/2014):\n\nThis is an extremely minor update that does 3 things.\n\n1. Fixed the final boss. Yes, there was supposed to be a final boss. Boss flags and level numbers made him not appear. \n2. Significantly dulled the palettes of level 7, 8, and 9 (green and red). I have no idea how pre-teen me could handle staring at those palettes since they make me dizzy looking at them for a few minutes. The dull colors are by no means great, but I can at least look at them. I have not updated the screenshots to reflect this change.\n3. Added an open door to the room that had a bunch of Pols Voice in level 3. I had never intended for the player to be forced to fight those with the wooden sword or even the level 2 sword and somehow legitimately thought you got the arrows before reaching them. This goes to show how awesome I was at not beta testing anything I made during this time period.\n\nYou're maybe wondering why I'm not bothering to update more despite fixing these issues. Truth be told, I want to keep this up as it is mostly as a record of what I did with my first (and still currently only at the time of writing this) released quest. Doing any major changes to it would ruin that. Of course I'm fully aware that modern ZC players that stumble on this update might play the quest and go \"what is this crap!?\" because of many of my more questionable design decisions (and believe me, there are plenty of them), but that's totally fair since standards change and this was honestly kind of average at most even for the time in my opinion. My own standards have changed since making this and I feel that I've grown as a quest maker since then.\n\nStill, there were people that had fun playing it and I admit I have fun going back and playing it every so often even if I cringe at some of the things I did. So that's why I decided to go through with submitting this update to fix these issues that have irked me for years.\n\nAlso, if there are any other bugs, feel free to mention them and I'll try to fix them if I can. Keep in mind that I'm using 1.90 and DOSBox is a huge pain to operate, so I may not get to everything.",
    "story": "Link is resting in his home one day when Abei appears from nowhere. He tells Link that Ganon found out where the secret island of the Dragon Triforce is and that he kidnapped Zelda as well. Abei then tells Link that big long legend you just read! Link want's to follow Zelda. Abei opens a book and chants a funny incantation. A stairway appears on the floor! Link walks in, and finds himself in a pitch black room! The mist in the room causes Link to pass out! He wakes up to find himself on an island shoreline. Wrote in the sand near the water is:\"Welcome to Dragon Island, the island out of normal human reach!\"The tide comes in and covers the message. Link sudden finds an octorock rushing towards him, ready for the kill (screen to the left of start). Link reaches for his sword, but it is not there. Neither is any of his other gear. The mist had took it from him and scattered it around the island! Also, Ganon had stolen the Master Sword and hid it in his hideout! Ganon also has several fake triforces that Link will have to collect to escape certain rooms! You will determain what Link will do!

    "description": "I started this quest before I first joined AGN back in October of 2000.... It was the first quest I worked on, and the last I'll work on... When it started it was BS-Style all the way... Then I started editing tiles, and added every feature I could possibly think of... then I stopped working on it for a long time...like six months...\n\nWhen I got a craving to work on it again, I came back to it, and 1.90 had just come out, I had to completely upgrade the quest to make room for the new items like the boots and the hookshot... I wanted to have all the possible features.... I came close to finishing the quest, but put it away for a while....\n\nAbout eight or so months later, Dark Nation has put out 1.92 build 163 (or whatever it was) and I get a craving to work on it again... I made so many edits and changes to this damned quest that I think it can't be anything but good at this point, so I'm determined to finish it... I still had much to do, four more underworlds, and quite a bit of fixing up.... \n\nAnd I lost all motivation... I didn't want to see the quest die. Damn i'd worked on it so long I wanted like hell to finish it.... but I knew I never would....\n\nAt the time JayeM was beta testing for me, and we would get to talking about the quest a lot.... and I knew she was very interested in the quest, but I felt so bad for not being able to finish it... So I figured Since I like her quest building style, and I certainly trust her judgment implicitly... I decided to give the quest to JayeM, because I know how much life she'd be able to breathe into it...\n\nThat was a few months ago... two I think... and she's done extraordinarily well with it... adding almost all of the new features from the new beta, developing the remaining dungeons that needed to be finished, as well as expand on the overworld a bit and add new sub levels... \n\nNow the time has come for her to need a beta tester, and I'm doing it myself. Bigjoe has also been beta testing, and has done a terrific job. He also helped out by adding new BS Enemies created by VEL. Special thanks to him.\n\nAnyways, I am truly amazed at how solid a quest this really is. I'm proud to have worked on it for so long, and I'm proud to have JayeM as it's other parent. I hope you'll all enjoy this quest as much as I do.",

I have yet to topple this contribution of mine to the Zelda Classic library. It houses 9 complete dungeons with a optional 'master' dungeon which is quite deviously hidden and poses a interesting challenge once inside. This uses the BS tileset to its fullest potential and I dare say it rivals Revenge 1 in terms of scope and quality as well as challenge. Level 8 and 9 have to be seen to be believed, the epitome of great BS tile dungeon design. A great quest in all aspects, highly recommended.\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Fixed misc. bugs, made sure all continue bugs squashed, and made various detail touch-ups across the board.\n3/25/07 - Fixed a fatal bug where you could do level 7 out of order and get yourself permenently stuck!",

Added many new things and re-arranged things to how I really wanted it to be when I looked back on the original quest in retrospect and wasn't happy with some of it. This is the definitive version of Hidden Duality, it has it all and then some.\n\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Fixed all Dodongo disappearing bugs, tried to squash the level 4 continue bug as best I could, altered various enemy placements throughout the quest. Made minor detail touch-ups across the board and finally eliminated that infinite rupee supplying bush combo in the snow area.",

    "story": "After Link saved Hyrule from the evil grasp of Ganon the kingdom of Hyrule prospered as a major center of trade.  Three other kingdoms called Tenn, Montar, and Frellan arose around Hyrule, as a result of its expansion.  Link put his weapons in the royal armory, because he had no need for them any longer, and the Triforce was placed in the throne room and heavily guarded.  Link moved to the kingdom of Tenn and began to raise a family.  But one fateful day Link was killed by a group of angry moblins; not even his great skill could save him.  For over 10 years Hyrule reigned as the largest kingdom in the world, but the remaining band of Ganon's army sought tirelessly to revive their once great leader.  After 11 long years they finally suceeded.  Ganon easily retook the Triforce in the absense of Link and brought Hyrule to its knees.  9 years later Ganon grew angry because even though he destroyed Hyrule, the three daughter kingdoms still prospered, so he sought to capture and destroy them as well.  He began by kidnapping the princess Julie of Frellan.  Then Ganon created strong-holds (in each Ganon put Link's weapons to keep them from any adventurous soul) in each of the kingdoms and sent his armies out to destroy the land.  Now it is up to Link's son, also named Link, to gather his father's weapons and destroy Ganon in the Dead Land.",

Old save files should work with this new quest file. If you downloaded a copy of the quest before July 6th, 2014, get the updated version linked here.This quest features a full overworld and about a dozen underworlds. It is relatively difficult, so I recommend playing it with a gamepad/controller rather than with the keyboard. PLAY THIS QUEST USING ZELDA CLASSIC 1.90 ONLY! Zelda Classic 1.90 is a DOS program, so your computer needs to be able to run DOS games to run 1.90.[If you cannot run Zelda Classic 1.90, 1.92 b184 should work sufficiently to accomplish all of the main objectives of the quest. If you can't run any 1.9X versions, don't bother trying 2.1X versions. 2.5X versions might lead to troubles that require quitting and loading game save files.]This game is free. I don't profit from it and, by downloading, you agree not to, either. Some of the tiles were taken from other games, but almost all have been uniquely modified. Any perceived trademark is parodied or unintentional. If you have a problem with the game, don't download it and/or delete it from your computer.

You notice, however, that enemies stand in your way and the twins seem to have locked themselves in their bedroom. After defeating those that interfere, one of the ladies explains that a wolf has stolen away her sister and, more importantly, her Gameboy. Vowing to return with it (and her), you set off, mowing down the evildoers.

    "description": "It borrows from the Wind Waker concept of a world with a big ocean; with islands dotting the landscape. Well since ZC is on a screen by screen basis, screens of just simply water would be boring as hell to travel through. So except in certain cases, there will be land in almost every screen on the massive 16x16 overworld. So its like Wind Waker, but the island are more jam-packed together. This prevents long sailing times on the raft and later, long swim times with the flippers. So I hope this speeds things up a bit.\nAnyway, there will be some story in the form of Aryll, your sister and townspeople in your home town, Goron City and Zora Cave. After levels 1, 7 and 8, you can return to these towns and get new information out of them and get a new item from Aryll.\nNow the game starts off on your home island and you MUST complete level 1 and then visit Aryll to get the raft so you can get off your island and explore the ocean. Now from here on in, you have FREE exploration through almost ALL the islands and areas of the huge overworld. You can tackle levels 2-7 in ANY order you choose. With the small exception of gaining flippers from level 5 to access level 6. Other than that, you are free to go and do what you want and where you want. Just note that the further dungeons you skip to, the harder it will be on you since you may have fewer hearts early in the game. \nNow as for secrets, here is a list:\n- 2 HC Pieces on each major island\n- 4 HC Pieces in 4 separate mini-dungeons found underwater in the vast ocean\n- 6 Magic upgrades on 6 minor islands\n- 8 Bomb upgrades on 8 major islands\n- 3 Extra required dungeons including the new optional Master Dome\n- Tons and Tons of rupees found on land, underwater, or found by defeating all enemies on certain overworld screens.\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Use beta 183 to play this!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nVer. 1.3 - Added more raft paths to make the overworld a bit more accessible. Added some more free super bombs due to complaints of players. Decreased the price on super bombs and magic shields in shops around the overworld. Should play smoother now.\nVer. 1.4 - Added a new mini-dungeon and added another raft path. Fixed  some more bugs and finished up with the suggestions made from the forums.\nVer. 1.5 - Fixed a potion shop in the 'dead town' so those player with no potions leftover from level 8 can have some relief.\nLatest Update: 6/12/2006 - Tried to squash as many Level A, B, C continue bugs as possible, even to the point that you can no longer start in those dungeons anymore. I hope the problem is fixed now. Also made general detail touch ups across the board.\nUpdate: Replaced the missing readme file mentioned in this description!",

While not quite as difficult as AlphaDawg's \"ZC official\" 3rd Quest, it will still provide Zelda experts with a considerable challenge and lots of interesting puzzles.\n\nFor those of you who are not *quite* skilled enough to consider yourselves Zelda \"experts,\" the quest comes with a complete FAQ/walthrough, written in question-hint-answer format, so that it won't take away the fun of figuring things out yourself.\n\nMaster Quest was built from BS 1st, as you can see, but numerous subtle improvements have been made including custom tiles, layering, landscape \"manicuring,\" area-specific MIDI themes, a new overworld palette, and even lowercase letters!  As for big changes, there is an entirely new overworld area for you to find and explore, and of course every dungeon is a completely new level.\n\nTo maintain the \"old school\" feel, I've purposely used only the original Zelda items, enemies, and bosses, and most of the other Zelda conventions from the original game still apply. The best way to prepare for Master Quest is to replay the original 2nd Quest. \n\nDespite these limitations, Master Quest's dungeons are huge compared to the original Zelda. It should provide even speedy players with more than 10 hours of gameplay.",

Check the Readme for a more interesting retelling of the prologue, which also gives a few hints about the dungeon shapes, just like the original game did!\n\nCreating this quest in ZC took 6 months, but many of the ideas I used have been forming since 1988, when I first played the original Legend of Zelda. So in a way, this quest has been in the making for 16 years. Enjoy. ",

Some of them are false walls.\n- If there are items you *know* you will need eventually, try to buy or find them as early as you can. MQ GREATLY rewards foresight.\n- Refer to the subscreen map often in dungeons. Mark unexplored areas, and remember where you need to go.  Backtrack often!\n- If you're stuck, search the overworld for hint-giving old men.  In MQ they really are helpful!\n\nIf all else fails, check the FAQ included in the zip file for hint-a-licious assistance.",

    "description": "(This quest was created by Phantom Menace and completed by Nightmare...)Back in 1999, Phantom Menace and I were working together on Zelda Classic (pretty much just us), and we made two separate quests. One was New Quest (mine) as everyone knows, the other was the Demo Quest, supposedly the try-out field for new features BEYOND Zelda Classic. As you know, New Quest was honored and remembered.Sadly, for our creator of Zelda Classic, Demo Quest never got finished as PM got sidetracked.So in the summer of 2004, five years later, I asked for permission to finish off Demo Quest to satisfy the urges of the oldbies wanting to save Zelda in that quest, as well as make it playable (if you thought James Quest 2 or Mega Man: DWR DC were hard, pick up Demo Quest from the AGN DB. Makes both of those look easy!) I was successful in updating and adding a lot of ZC's new features and tricks into Demo to re-create the feel it had back in 1999, with new features as well. It's also MUCH more playable now. Unfortunately, much as I love his work, PM tended to be a much better Zelda player than me and his quests were designed that way. Everyone should have a chance now rather than just 3-4 players.Updated 02/09/05 to fix bug in Level 4.Updated April 2015 to version 2.50.Patch 3 Notes 5/31/20171. Wizzrobes fixed2. Some warps fixed3.

    "description": "Here is Molka, a Quest I finished 2 or 3 years ago. Now you're probably thinking, \"Old graphics? Are you kidding me?\" Well, here's my wisdom; this Quest will prove that Quests can still be good if they're in the old graphics. This Quest contains 13 levels (all required to win) and a whole lotta things to uncover. Along with the old gfx are many custom-drawn gfx that I drew myself (the gfx themselves weren't all that hard to draw; it's the COMBOS that really rock), and also don't forget that the music that comes with this Quest is, in more than my own opinion, excellent.\n\nBefore you begin, remember that this Quest is a challenging one. The levels are not ridiculously hard, but they do make you think. Lots of puzzles are in this Quest...  trust your gizmos.\n\nSo, for your enjoyment, I give you...  MOLKA!!\n\n***Updated 8/14/07*** Fixed some long-outstanding bugs, such as not being able to exit from a later dungeon until you've beaten it (and that dungeon required Bait too, so O_o on that), various Continue bugs (though they're not eliminated, they are now no longer game-stopping) and I also removed the things the Bosses say to you when you fight them 'cause Link can't move and the Boss often can get in a free hit. Not cool. Lastly, I added 4 new screenshots. ",
    "story": "Molka is a mountain land, inhabited by strong, hearty folks. This land was peaceful enough, as Ganon had never touched the place. Well, THAT'S because Ganon did NOT know that Molka had a triforce of it's own! The Triforce of Gizmos allowed it's owner mastery over his or her items. Link could've used something like this in his first adventure, couldn't he? Well, also in Molka were new items that Link or anyone in Hyrule had never heard of before. The Whistle of the Winds was an example.\n\n  Ganon always seems to revive himself after being defeated, huh? It's true. Link and Ganon have faced off so many times it's not even funny. (That's thanks to anyone who's ever made a Zelda Classic Quest!) So, Ganon revives himself again and goes at it, thinking of another way to defeat Link. After 3 days of thinking, Ganon bolts out of his chair and yells, \"I HAVE IT! I know how to defeat Link! I just have to kidnap Zelda to a land with tougher enemies!\" All his minions applauded. What a plan! It was brilliant!\n\n  Ganon sent out scouts to find a land with really hard enemies. They found one: Molka. \"Great job, boys!\" Ganon said to the scouts. \"Let's prepare to strike!\" And with that, Ganon and his minions started building the Dark Base, a floating dungeon that could travel anywhere. In 2 weeks, it was finished. Ganon took Zelda the next night, as she was walking out on her balcony to gaze at the stars, and transported her up into the Dark Base. Then they flew to the mountain of Molka, putting Ganon's plan fully in action. Ganon just had to wait for Link.\n\n  The Hyrulians didn't panic. This has happened before. Zelda's been kidnapped a lot, so they knew the drill. Rebuild the Triforce, send Link to Level 9, defeat Ganon. Right? Well, that's when the Hyrulian messenger reported that Ganon escaped to Molka. OOPS, this ain't part o' the drill! NOW they panicked. But Link didn't. Already he was thinking of a way to get to Molka.\n\n  He went home that night with no plan. His sidekick, a Wind Wizzrobe (who he met secretly in A Link to the Past), tried to cheer him up a bit. He knew how to play Link's whistle better than Link, so he played a song for him. Link didn't cheer up. \"I've been on many adventures before, but Molka...  I don't even know where Molka is!\" The Wizzrobe stopped playing and looked at Link, hard. \"Did you say, MOLKA?\" Silence. \"Link, I lived in Molka during your first adventure! I know where it is!\"\n\n  By the next day, Link was prepared to go. The laws of Molka stated that most Hyrulian items were not allowed within the land. So, Link was bringing his Boomerang, Wooden Sword, and a Blue Potion with him. Even the Red Ring stayed behind. Once he was all ready, the Wind Wizzrobe blew him in a tornado to the city in Molka. It worked!\n\n  Now, Link knew where he had to go. The Triforce of Gizmos, still undetected by Ganon, was hid away hundreds of years ago in 8 pieces, each piece inside one of the dangerous Forts of Molka. These Forts also contained legendary Molkian items (like the Whistle of the Winds), allowing Link even more power. Only once Link had completely mastered his items would he be able to reach the Dark Base floating over the northeastern corner of Molka. And the best part is, Ganon doesn't even know Link is prepared so well. He doesn't know what he's askin' for!!!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "-Molka's Forts are chalk full of secret passages. Try getting the Map as soon as possible so you can find these passages better. Even without the Map, once you've gotten far enough in the Quest, you'll just know where things are.\n\n -Ganon's right about tougher enemies. In the later levels, you may be fighting a whole room of Blue Darknuts, or even 4 Manhandlas! There are Potion shops about, MAKE GOOD USE OF 'EM.\n\n -Statues are everywhere on the mountain. Use an item on them that they relate to, to clear a path. Memorize the paths on this mountain, learn 'em well. As you collect items from the Forts, you'll definitely need to move backward in order to move forward.\n\n -You can carry a maximum of 20 Bombs, once you find the shops. Some items are extremely rare and not required to win. The Magic Key can be bought for 980 Rupees. See, you weren't meant to have it! Try the Gold Ring instead. It's only about 700 Rupees.  \n\n-Like I said above, I made a \"workaround\" for the continue bug if you're using 2.10 instead of 1.92, but this still starts you out in the Boss Room. If you want to stop fighting the Boss over and over and get a potion or whatever, you still have to Quit->Save. It's the best I could manage to be compatible with both 1.92b and 2.10. Nothing major though.",

It has 9+ full levels (some of them with multiple floors or maps), several mini-dungeons, and a full overworld map (half is the Dark World, half the Light World). It uses many of the newer items used in Zelda Classic and should be played using version 2.10.\n\nUpdate: Fixed a warp bug in the mountains that would let the player access the Dark World earlier than planned which can be almost game ending.",
    "story": "Princess Zelda knew that she didn't have much time until evil returned to the land of Hyrule. She decided to head out to a remote island, far from Hyrule, where she could safely hide the Triforce of Wisdom from the clutches of evil. She told no one of her plans except for her noble aid, Impa. As Zelda was trying to hide the last four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom on the island, she was captured by a renegade group of Moblins in the forest. The Moblin tribe was attempting to create an entrance to the Dark World so they could once again be together with their master, Ganon. The Moblins were successful and were able to open a path to the Dark World and turned Zelda over to Ganon. Ganon knew that it wouldn't be long before Link learned of Zelda's fate, so he scattered the other four pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom throughout the Dark World. Ganon then commanded the rest of his minions find the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom Zelda hid so that he could claim them as his own. Back in Hyrule, there was much concern when the princess was reported as missing for a long period of time. Impa then decided to seek help with Link, the Hero of Time. When Link learned of Zelda's capture, he immediately set out to rescue her from Ganon's clutches. On the way to the island, his ship was damaged in a storm and he lost all his possessions, becoming shipwrecked on the island. Starting his adventure without even having his trusty sword at his side, Link must find a way to navigate this new island to find the princess and rescue her from Ganon.",

It was originally made before you could link strings together, so in order to get the full story and talk to other characters, you have to pay for info a lot.  But I provide lots of rupees, so don’t worry.  The quest is about Metroids and Samus with cameos from other characters.  It is fairly simple and linear.  It consists of Samus traveling to a series of different planets on her quest to catch Ridley.  The dungeons start out easy, but get a little harder toward the end.  At the very end, I decided that the very last dungeon (with Fett) was a little hard, so I provided a way to view a fast ending in case you don’t want to play all the way through the last dungeon.  But if you do stick with it and beat the entire game, you get a much more rewarding ending.  The storyline may seem a little similar to Meitroid Prime: Hunters, because it’s about Samus battle other bounty hunters, but I actually finished this quest many years before the DS ever came out.  I'm only just now getting around to redoing some tiles and uploading it.",

    "description": "This is my Zelda Classic Quest story, that I started. It will have at least three chapters, maybe four, depending on where I go with the third chapter.  WARNING. This quest starts off relatively hard, then lulls you into a false sense of being easy, and then bombards you with the near impossible at the end. Needless to say, it is not for the average Zelda Classic player. So don't complain, you've been warned.",
    "story": "This chapter is sort of an adaptation of many of the LOZ stories. It begins where Link just beat Ganon to save Zelda. However, just because Ganon was defeated and encapsulated in stone doesn't mean that Ganon's minions are gone. On the way back to Hyrule Castle, Link was mobbed by a massive amount of darknuts. Unfortunately, the darknuts overwhelmed Link, and took all of his goods and Zelda. Now Link must save Zelda wherever she is. Link also recalls that Zelda told him of a 'blue Triforce' that, when combined, would let the worthy claim the true Triforces of Power, Courage, and Wisdom. Now Link must set off to save Zelda and claim the 'blue Triforce'.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Tip 1: Don't get frustrated. This quest is not designed to be completed in five minutes. In fact the fastest run I made wasn't less than 10 hours. It is also designed to be tough, but not too tough. So if you are dying consistently, then either you need more hearts or better equipment. Tip 2: Explore everywhere! HCP's are direly needed in the quest as you don't get Heart Containers. The problem is that I counted the number of HCP's and the count comes out different each time. (it is between 81-84 but it really doesn't matter, you'll see why toward the end of the game.) So keep playing. Tip 3: PAY FOR THE HINTS!!! This will REALLY help your progression in the quest. Also, for those who can't get through, I will be making a walkthrough on a site here in the not so distant future, so keep your eyes open. If you have any questions, post them and I will see how to answer them to the best of my ability.\nwww.geocities.com/darthpikachu21/Level1.html",

    "story": "intro: \n\tabout 500 years years ago, Link, the hero of time fought an evil man named Ganon inthe land of Hyrule for the power of the triforce, and rescued princess zelda. then something else happend, ganon reterned again, the land of hyrule got flooded, the hero of the winds defeated Ganon AGAIN, founded the new Hyrule, and did some other things. \n\tThen came the mushroom kingdom, the Beanbean kingdom, Tofu, Bowser, Mario, the internet, animation, ETC. ETC. ETC. \n\t\nStory:\n\tthe story starts out as most of wario's bussness ventures do. one day he's laying on the couch and he sees an advertisement on TV. \"NEW! FROM GAMECO! the massivly multiplayer online RPG smash hit that everyone's talking about! WORLD OF EVERLIFE 2! play with people from around the globe! incredibly addicting! only $50 and an additonal $15 a month!\" \n\tso then the microscopic peanut that is wario's brain acheves the following train of thought; \"hey! if I make an addictive-a smash hit thingey, mabey I can-a charge ridiculous amounts of a-money! and the best part is that they'll-a PAY MY HUGE FEES NO MATTER WHAT! but who should I a-chose to be in charge of the project, hmmm... Mona has a job at that pizza place, Jimmy likes go a-goof of and a-dance insted of a-work, Dribble is too big, Spitz is-a to short, orblon only has-a 3 fingers, Dr. Crygor is to-a... err... never mind him, Wait! I have it! I'll get 9-volt to a-do it! he a-loves nintendo games-a so much he cant say no to me! unless Mario (blech!) a-tells him not-a to. but what are the odds of-a that? mwa ha ha! I'm so smart!\" \n\tjust as wario expected, 9-Volt agreed to make the game so 9-Volt got a new computer with a 999 Gigahertz pressesor,a 500 gigabyte hard drive, and a neat-o USB controller. a few weeks later, the game was open for a private Gamma test (a gamma test is like a beta test only more so) and 9-volt just finished tranfering his entire NES game collection to the hard drive of the computer when 9-volt, to his horror acidently hit the \"transfer all dowloaded data to game and scatter about in the form of the Triforce\" button (who's Idea was to put a button that did that?) so 9-volt went and played the game to find all 8 peces of the triforce, and at the same time stop the illigal hacking going on in the game. \n\t9-volt thought \"let's start in hyrule....",

Now the Triforce Pieces are guraded by Ganon's greatest warriors and Link must find somehow to get through the several dungeons of Snortsia and claim the pieces. Link had forgot his weapons in Hyrule so he must go and retrieve the wooden sword that is hidden within a dungeon. Once he has that, Link heads on to find his rewards.

I put a lot of side quests in the quest so it can have a feel to most Zelda games. The storyline fits into the major storyline and I do try to connect them all together. I spent a lot of time on the storyline and I hope you like it. This is what you can expect from the quest:-Travel through huge Forests, islands, caves, deserts, graveyards, mountains, towns, as well as Dreams.-Come face to face to some of the old Hero's of Hyrule.-Meet different cultures and races of Hyrule.-Fight some original custom bosses like Wolfblin and King Dodongo.-Play some great mini games like bow and arrow target practice and rafting.-See some original puzzles never seen in ZC.-Huge Dungeons with different themes.-and More!10/12/2011 Update - 5 years later, I came back and polished the game up. Here are some of things I added:-Donmore's Cave is redesigned!-Wondering Tree is redesigned!-The Thieves' Hideout is redesigned!-The Irony Cave is redesigned!-The Grave Cave is added.-New puzzles in some of the levels, as well as some hints to make puzzles more clear.-String Count went from 1400 to 2000!-Cave of Ordeals added!-Extra Level and Extra Ending for those Hardcore players!-And a lot more... But play the game to find out!11/3/2013-Few bug updates. Gohma 4 is no longer in my game... *runs*3/17/2015-Fixed a bug in Cave of Ordeals.  No other updates.",
    "story": "On a small island just outside of Hyrule lived a boy named Link. As he grew up, he knew he was destined to become the new Hero of Hyrule. The Robins who were neighbors of Link, told him that the bloodline of the Hero’s past through him. He knew that on any given day his adventure could begin.One day Link was drawing a picture of a sword on the mountainside of the island. He looked down at his shield that he always kept with him, and thought how cool it would be to finally use it with a sword of his own. Just then his good friend Patty walked over to him. She looked a little sad, as she told him that she was going to leave the island soon in search for the Shooting Star Legend. In that moment, they both looked at the shoreline and noticed that the water was acting very violent. But they brushed it off. As Link finished the drawing, he signed his name on the bottom of the sword. Patty was still talking about that legend; however, Link couldn’t keep his eyes off the coastline, which was getting worse by the second.Little did they know, the Dark Army had just docked south of the city of Fulton. The Commander of the Army stepped out to dock while discussing the plan to this staff, “Continue searching for the remaining Triforce pieces. We will capture Fulton and await you there!” As the Commander looked at the path to Fulton, he whispered to himself, “And now it begins.”",
    "tipsAndCheats": "First of all don’t use any cheats on this game because of the amount of events I put in this game. Second this game is huge. Expect 15-25 hours on this game. If you don’t like huge games I say pass it up. Third, the game does get a little hard. I suggest you getting POTIONS whenever possible. You are going to die quite a bit, but don’t worry you will end up passing it. If you have any questions ask in the forum and I will help you out. Also make sure to read the story because they give you a lot of hints for things you need to do.\n\nAlso here is a link to my Director's Commentary on my game. It is a Walkthrough on my entire game in case you get stuck:\nhttp://www.youtube.c...h?v=ZolhyIu-gFA\n\nThis game is for 2.10. Please play it in 2.10!",

Here is a hint to get the legendary items in an unmapped room. Level 4, while you are about to ride the first minecart, walk-through wall is above. Go through it and you can get the Farore's Wind. Level 5, after you rode the minecart, behind the pots is a walk-through wall. Get the Nayru's love. Level 6, in a room where there is just a rectangular lava, the right side is bombable. \nEnter through it and get the magic key. Don't leave the room yet, the right wall is a walk-through to get Din's fire. The legendary items are as the items from SNES A link to the past. Bombos medallion is Din's fire, Ether medallion is Nayru's love and quake medallion is Farore's wind.\n\nThere are unmapped rooms in all dungeons where there is 10 rupies. Accessed by blowing a hole in the wall by a bomb.\n\nLink's bed at Link's house is also a life restoring room. Walk to the far right side of the bed to restore Life energy.\n\nBe sure to buy the arrows at the village before going to the level 2 dungeon. Also you may need to buy an extra key before going in dungeon levels 2, 3, 5 and 6 (even 7 but if you've found the magic key in 6, you don't have to worry).

Lots of grottos and caves to explore as well as many secrets to find.\n\nExpect an easy to medium difficulty. I wanted to design a quest that was enjoyable and slightly different.  I hope you have as much fun playing this quest as it was designing it!  \n\nUPDATED 6.8.06 Because of stupid mistake on my part.\n\nUPDATED 6.18.06 Fixed the bombable walls in Level Three.\n\nUPDATED 11.4.06 A slightly bigger update:\n\n1. Fixed the number of continue hearts from 50% to 6. Makes it a little fairer for players in the beginning but a little more difficult as you get far into the quest.\n\n2. Changed the music for Level One.\n\n3. It is now possible to find a blue potion before Level Two. Players of this quest will know what I'm talking about. My advice is to not use it until you get to Level Two. No, I didn't change the Level 2 block puzzle. Deal with it.\n\n4. Added one more house, its purpose is to give some hints on a couple of items/places and to provide somewhat of a story. Changed Jen's house accordingly.",

    "story": "Gannon is at it again.  10000 years ago, a young hero took up the Golden Blade and sent him back to the Underworld.  But now, 10000 years later, he has come back with a taste for revenge.  This time he wants to destroy the planet, and to that, he must corrupt Inner Land.\n\nA young hero at Inner Land is alerted of the nearing forces of Gannon, and must journey out to stop Gannon and save the planet.  Joined with the the knowledge of the ancients, Kendrus must attain the Golden Power and destroy Gannon. Gather items across the many lands of the planet, various heart pieces and containers, and most importantly - the 8 shards of the Golden Power.   \n\nIt won't be easy.  The closer Kendrus gets to Gannon's lair in Hyrule (now Ancient Hyrule), the stronger and more intense the enemy forces become.  But in the end, Kendrus must prevail.",

Link's job was to go deep into Death Mountain and search for the terrifying fire-breathing Gleeok that used his Darknut minions to steal the Triforce of Power from the Great Realm.

I suggest that before entering into the Gleeok's land in the northern part of the mountains, that you bring a good shield and some bombs.\n*Helpful Glitch* If you find the enemy you must defeat in order to gain access to the castle difficult, try going after the enemy flames instead \nSee if you can find a very helpful item in the castle.",

    "description": "This quest was made, completed and finished within 3 months about 8 months ago. (about March or April of this year) But it was delayed in release because Petoe and I wanted it to be a simultaneous release with Lost Isle. But since Lost Isle is being delayed for a while due to quality assurance and other issues, we decided to release this early. So technically, this was the first quest finished with the DOR tileset, but probably not the first DOR tileset quest to be released because of this. However, as a promotion for our upcoming Lost Isle in 2007, there is a hidden info guy in the quest that gives you tips not on Wolfstyle, but on Lost Isle! Just to inspire you!\nAs for the quest itself: It is a small quest with a 64 screen overworld only 7 main dungeons and a newly added Master Dome that wasn't present in the original. It is a completely remake of my very first quest the way it should have been. The overworld is expanded to fully realize the original vision and although the dungeons retain the same layout as the original, playing them is a whole different ballgame. \nThere is no special tricks or nothing fancy to interest those who are looking for something new in the ZC scene. It is simply a fun, short romp through quality Zelda that has the ability to be time-runned for those daring to make a time attack of it. \nFurthermore, I have fully implemented a difficulty setting in the quest itself! A normal mode for casual players and a hard mode for hardcore players. Don't complain about the absurdity of the challenge in hard mode, it was made for you to NOT win easily and it was made to be a bit cheap. But testers like Love for Fire and Ouch! have proven that hard mode can be beaten. If you can't take it, play normal mode like all the rest.\nChanges in hard mode: red potions are for sale instead of blue, the magic sword is for sale now and the master sword is now the prize of the Master Dome. The gold ring is now hidden somewhere.\nEnjoy!\n\nNOTE: USE BETA 183 TO PLAY THIS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nUpdate 08 March 07: Made a few minor corrections in strings and edited a few graphical bugs out.\nUpdate 21 March 07: Made a major update so players wouldn't get stuck with lockblocks.",

After his quest ended, Link was anxious to see the princess of his own land, so he quickly returned home. To his surprise, Zelda invited him to her zecret hideout, Zelda Falls, in the northwest corner of Hyrule. Link was only too happy to go, but he really should have brought more than Rupees and a shield; waiting for him was yet another adventure.\n\nUpon his arrival in Zelda Falls, Link walked through the waterfall to Zelda's cave. She presented him with a new wooden sword for his birthday. \"As if I don't already have a million of these,\" he thought to himself as he left.\n\nLess than a minute later, Link discovered a small underground palace. It was infested with enemies, but Link made short work of them. Strangely enough, Zelda was waiting for him in a room nearby. \"You have to help me Link!\" she told him. Apparently, Zelda's younger sister, Miriam, had recently gone missing. Link suspected Ganon at work, but Zelda insisted that she just wandered off.

Not only have I updated the quest for a new tileset, but I've gone through from start to finish and made changes and improvements. Some are subtle, some are major. Overall, the game now plays even more like the original Zelda, to enhance your enjoyment of a considerable challenge.\n\nAs time has gone by, the BS tileset has evolved, and so has my quest design style. Having released the 1st and 2nd Quests unpassworded in the New BS tileset, I started to desire to remake my original ZC quest, \"Legend of Zelda: Master Quest,\" using the New BS tileset and a new way of doing things. \n\n\nNew improvements and additions include:\n\n- Completely redesigned BS Link sprites, modeled after the BS mascots and Classic Link (drawn by Dart Zaidyer and Radien).\n- Updated dungeons.\n- Truer classic-style gameplay.\n- Lowered frustration factor.\n- Redesigned level 9 featuring returning themes from 1st and 2nd Quest.\n- All known instances of the continue bug have been thwarted and eliminated.\n- Unpassworded quest file for enlightenment, amusement, and personalized play.\n- Updated companion FAQ helps you with stumper puzzles as much as ever.\n\n\nI've tested this quest extensively, and it should have fewer bugs than the original. However, beta testers were in short supply, so if you should come across ANY bug whatsoever, please tell me. I will do whatever necessary to fix the bug for you personally.",

Some of them are false walls.\n- If there are items you *know* you will need eventually, try to buy or find them as early as you can. MQ GREATLY rewards foresight.\n- Refer to the subscreen map often in dungeons. Mark unexplored areas, and remember where you need to go. Backtrack often!\n- If you're stuck, search the overworld for hint-giving old men.  In MQ they really are helpful!\n\nIf you need more help, check the FAQ included in the zip file for hint-a-licious assistance.\n\n\nAnd last but not least, if you want to cheat like crazy, open up the quest file in ZQuest and mess around to your hearts content. Since the quest is unpassworded, it uses the four standard cheat codes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. But remember, true Zelda gamers try to finish the game without cheats. ",

This is Legend of Zelda: Origin.\n\nDeveloper Description:\nDespite people commonly dismissing many remakes or revamps or in this case, re-envisioning of the original Zelda quests, this goes far beyond what you have ever seen for the 1st and 2nd quests. First off straight from the get-go you have a choice to either start the 1st or the 2nd quest in the same quest file. There is also an option for a 3rd xtreme quest after beating the second or straight from the get-go for those insane Gung-ho players. To top it off, you have selection of choice for which dungeons you want to play over the course of Xtreme 3rd. Three Quests in one, can you handle it?\nMassive changes with everything built from scratch. Heart containers on the overworld are now divided into 15 HC Pieces, the remaining 5 scattered across mini-games which you must win to acquire them. New secret locations, new cave systems, new dungeon layouts that do not conform to the original in anything but shape, every single item in ZC is utilized and can be acquired, a new Dome of Trials has opened up in the world, the ability to save Zelda in a variety of ways and finally a special bonus challenge for those who manage to complete Xtreme 3rd. This is everything you've been wanting to see for the originals, but never saw previously in any quest thus far.

    "description": "Over 2 years in the making, the first full group collaboration quest has finally been completed. Lost Isle takes you on a journey to a deserted island where the formal inhabitants have suffered a catastrophic event and all that remains is the dead and the decaying. A sinister story unfolds the further you explore the island and evil secrets are revealed as you get closer and closer to the true evil that is conspiring against you. You will travel through ghost towns, graveyards, swamps, forests, volcanos, wastelands and canyons in your search for answers and a way off this haunted island. With one gigantic world to explore, five huge dungeons, an entire island-wide cave system, many misc. dungeons and catacombs to explore, optional triforce pieces, 36 pieces of heart, myriad of shields and potions, hidden secrets and lurking ghosts; this adventure will test your very limits as an explorer. Only the true intrepid players will see the quest through and claim the much -deserved ending. This is Lost Isle, you have been warned adventurer!Lost Isle Video WalkthroughMay no longer work in the Lost Isle Build.",
    "story": "You (as Link) have crash-landed on a seemingly deserted island out in the middle of the ocean. With no real reference point to indicate where exactly you are in the world, you have no choice but to explore the island and find some way of getting off of it and back to the mainland.  \n\nThough it appears that there was once a civilization here that was thriving, all that has turned to dust and dead bodies.  Undead and foul creatures fill the villages and take shelter in the woods and creep through the dark corners of the island.  What could have caused this great catastrophe and is this great evil still alive and well as you explore the very land that it destroyed?\n\nWelcome to Lost Isle...",

It shouldn't be hard to figure out where to go next, and it is only moderately difficult. This quest uses old school graphics (aside from layers), with plenty of custom made tiles and whatnot. There are 18 dungeons total (15 per class) on 1 overworld map.\n\nGreat replay value.",

You can buy all sorts of useful items there.\n\nLater in the game, there is a single superbomb. Use it in the right place (it's obvious) and you can get basically infinite coins. Great for buying everything in the town.\n\nLastly, the wizard will get items like the wand, potions, and magic spells. The knight gets items like the hammer, the gold ring, and the master sword.",

    "description": "This quest is, in my opinion, 2 complete overworlds and 9 full dungeons of pure Zelda. Taking 2 and a half years to construct this quest, expect to have anywhere from 15 to 30 or more hours of solid gameplay. The difficulty is not over-the-top, yet you'll encounter many interesting puzzles, many of which are totally new to Zelda. This quest includes almost every item; you'll find two in each of the quest's eight main dungeons and one in each mini-dungeon. You'll encounter Zelda's typical overworld areas, including a forest, lake, mountain, swamp, snowy mountain, and more. You can also amass a full 16-heart life gauge and a full 8-unit magic meter. Additionally, I've taken great care in making sure that grammar is perfect and that directions are as clear as possible.\n\nNote: I strongly suggest that you do not use a 2.5 beta to play this quest, as you will encounter several compatibility bugs that may inhibit you from completing the quest. Please use version 2.10. \n\nRegardless, I hope that you truly enjoy Link to the Heavens and that you have a load of fun. Many already have, so don't miss your chance.\n\nLast update: 9/15/09. This update will likely be my last, as it fixes a few minor miscellaneous errors or inconsistencies.",

He steps out his house keeping in mind that he needs to seek out the Triforce, and this is where the story begins...",

It will mess up level 3's MIDI, but I couldn't find a better midi that didn't do the same thing.  All of the others work fine.\n\nWARNING:  This can be a VERY CHALLENGING quest from what everyone has told me. It was actually more challenging than what I thought it would be for everyone.  \n\nUPDATE: Golden arrow shop is now a special item room- so it's obtainable now;  level 9 typo- fixed; small detail tiles added in as well;  \n\nPer requests: Faster scrolling dungeons/overworld; 2 more hidden bomb upgrade shops -now for a total of 4 upgrades!  \n\n\n2nd UPDATE: Level 4 map is now accessible.

Tons of songs arranged from a variety of old games.The overworld should look a little familiar, I got the idea looking through the packaged booklets from my old Zelda cartridges. I made the game easy to moderate difficulty I guess, it's hard to tell. I also made an extremely thorough walk through for the quest, where you can choose to see limited information on where to go next, a detailed set of instructions for what to do, an item/HCP checklist with locations, and complete maps for every section of the game.

    "story": "Story, abridged version....Somewhere between Zelda 1 and Zelda 2 on the timeline:Ganon appeared out of nowhere. He stole the triforce, but luckily the triforce of wisdom had been split up across the land to keep him from getting his hands on it. He waited for somebody else to do his work for him. Ganon attacked the newly built North Castle and took it for myself. Luckily, the King had not had a chance to move everything and make it his new home.The forces of Hyrule were divided, although most of them stood in the Great Palace, an old castle where the kings of Hyrule have ruled for generations. There was one village that had to actually move from their homes into the nearby mountains. A small entourage protects a young swordsman of the Link bloodline as he travels from the Great Palace to the hidden safety of New Kasuto, and was ambushed along the way. He finds himself unarmed at the entrance of a cave with enemies all around him.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- Each level has 2 items in it, plus a heart container and triforce piece.- Each minilevel has 1 item and a HCP for the boss (the first minilevel has a full heart container).- 4 of the optional dungeons have an item and HCP (the first has 2 of each actually)- 3 of the optional dungeons have a magic spell and a magic container.- Each town has a HCP within its boundaries, or in an area next to the town with no enemies at all.- Bombable rocks are all obvious in the overworld, most burnable bushes are too.- Your bombs and fire will not hurt you.- Getting lost in the Lost Woods is easy to do. Use the whistle to open a portal to the beginning.- When you die or quit, you start out with full health, which is great for dungeons. Do you need to get back to one of the rooms near the entrance, but don't want to go through all those rooms to get back? There's no downside to strategically quitting and continuing (unless you're trying to collect rupees or refill bombs along the way back).- Walkthrough.... I can't make it any easier than that.",

I played through so many times I'm sick of looking at the quest.this is version 0.81BUG FIX: info shops used wrong stringsthis version 0.9FATAL BUG FIX: L9 1st Floor got stuck. I used an apparently-unintended exploit (the x makes it sound cool) of the room rules for it to work. When the bug was identified and removed in v2.5x, my exploit broke, and you couldn't get through the room. Running old zc v2.10, you are able to get through L9. It looks like this has been broken in 2.5x since at least 2016, but probably was somewhere in the beta before 2.5x's official release.bug fix: A locked door in L9 2nd Floor should have been 1-way instead of shutter on the other side. It acted as an unintended trap to make you repeat rooms, if you didn't have the magic key and if you took a particular route, although it was just an annoyance. Now the door is no longer a trap.bug fix: A re-enabling bubble was missing from the Secret Grave dungeon in the large graveyard.bug fix: Rocks were added north of North Castle to prevent somebody from getting stuck.rebalancing: Added re-enabling bubbles to a room next to the starting room of all dungeons/minidungeons that have permanently-disabling bubbles somewhere in them.rebalancing: Ruto magic game, the crazy impossible room has a second target you can hit and the timed warp has been removed.aesthetic: One overworld screen had a black square under the armos instead of the same tile as the ground.typo: Fixed the name of Midoro Palace on the dungeon map.typo: Fixed ending credits link to PureZC.",

    "story": "Long ago, on a far away planet, there was a peaceful society called Soshi Valley, which was inhabited by lizard creatures called Soshis. Shunned by the other Soshis, was small group of them called Dark Soshis. They believed that without living beings, the universe was perfect, that life was a waste of space. And so they dedicated their lives to killing everything on the planet that breathed. After that had achieved this, they would use their dark powers to put an end to themselves, so the universe could thrive on its own, untouched by unnatural forces. But even they knew that they could never hope to accomplish this on their own, so they combined their powers and creating an all-powerful object called the Sludge Orb. Off of it spawned a giant creature made out of a poisonous slimy substance, and he was called king sludgious. However, he was defeated when one of the Soshi elders joined the Dark Soshis, learned their dark  magic, and used it to create what came to be called the Soshi Orb, which was then used to destroy the Sludge Orb. The elders knew that if the Soshi orb fell into the wrong hands, there would be no way to stop it. So they created seven trials, and hid pieces of the Soshi orb in each one. The eight piece rested in the home of the elders.\n\nMany years later, the Dark Soshis, although were beginning to abandon their quest for universe wide death, they still lived on in secrecy, completely unaware of what their ancestors had done, until they came across an ancient book, written by one of the Soshi elders of that time. These Dark Soshis were extremely full of them selves, and thought that the Sludgiens were only defeated the first time because they weren't god enough. So they revived the Skudge Orb, spawning a new, even more powerful than the first. However, it wasted most of its power into more sludgien troops, as he was very greedy, and the Dark soshis became his slaves. So the elders did what they always do in times of darkness. They looked to ancient prophesies for help. By doing this, they found that the only way to save Soshi Vally this time was to find \"the hero by the name of his own species\" and have him complete the seven trials created by the ancient elders, retrieve the seven Soshi Orbs hidden within them, find the eighth Soshi Orb, and us them to defeat King Sludgious II. So the elders called forth Soshi, the hero by the name of his own species, to save them from certain doom before it was too late!",

    "description": "Disclaimer: This quest features NSFW content not suitable for minors.\n\nThis story type DoR quest was started one and half a year ago, aiming to reach all players and fit in the Zelda timeline right after ALttP, but eventually I patched the quest with ideas from many games (mostly Ultima, Mega Man and Final Fantasy) and created an own story, the first episode of the Bloodline Saga.\n\nThe new thing is that the main character isn't Link, rather Knil and he has a girlfriend, Myra. You can explore two worlds with them, collecting three kind of main collectibles (Triforce piece aka Lightforce piece is just one of them). Also, Ganon is entirely out from the game, the head villain is Vaati.\n\nContents:\n-Altogether about 7 and a half size of mass overworlds\n-12 mandatory big dungeons\n-8 subdungeons\n-1 mandatory minidungeon\n-3 secret dungeons\n-1 small and 2 big sidequests\n-13 custom bosses not counting the final boss\n-3 main endings and some secret ones\n-ALL items used\n-some events/plot twists heavily directed towards affecting your emotions\n-many custom enemy and item tiles\n-cameos from games and from PureZC\n\nThe first overworld starts out as almost simple, then the complexity of lands and dungeons keep increasing til the last dungeons where I needed to use 5-7 DMaps for one floor. The difficulty is quite high, but you can use ZC player tricks at many places and you also can find HCPs and bomb upgrades fast. There are graphics from many different tilesets and sprite resources, including many custom (or mostly just edited) ones. Music is partially from VGmusic, but the official maestro was Nuvo.\n\nNote that Knil&Myra's first goal is to escape from Hyrule. As soon as they accomplish that, you shall never return to the Light World, not to the Hyrule as you knew it... so if you don't get an item in Hyrule, you never can go back to it. Considering things like that only the Light World has magic containers, we can say that how you play in the beginning determines what can you do... outside of... \"Hyrule\". Before and after that, pay attention to any clues and speak with all NPCs, because the road from one mandatory place to the next one isn't framed with airstation reflectors. I provide any help you need if you stuck, so relax.\n\nThe ZIP file contains no fly, but a ReadMe file that holds important and maybe interesting information, also a new SFX.dat file with sound effects specially for BB (mostly from ALttP). Move the original SFX.dat to a safe folder, before pasting BB's SFX.dat into your 2.10 folder.\n\nThis makes me remember, use ZC2.10.0 if you want to minimalize the amount of bugs, which is, hopefully, zero if you indeed use 2.10.\n\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.bbflashsite.co.nr made by Twilight_Knight\n\nMADE IN HUNGARY\n\nEnjoy! \n\nUpdate 1: [19. Nov. '08] Fixed many bugs, including the elimination of many blank warps. Improved design at 2 places. Improved credits. There's an urgent bugfix for ALL bosses, so download as soon as possible!\n\nUpdate 2: [22. Nov. '08] Fixed many smaller and huge bugs from beginning to last dungeon. Added Hungarian and Dutch ReadMe files!\n\nUpdate 3: [03. Dec. '08] Fixed many bugs, mostly involving warps. Added cheats, I hand them to those in need (permanently stuck or such).\n\nUpdate 4: [15. Dec. '08] Various little and big bugfixes. Credit amendment.\n\nUpdate 5: [1. Apr. '09] Some huge bugs and a whole lot of graphical issues fixed.",

    "description": "No, No ZQDX for you yet lol\n\n   This was another little innovative experiment of mine, inspired by the swordless runs of 1st and 2nd. They usually use all sorts of things to run through dungeons and grab something to use in place of a sword, usually going through a lot of danger. Well, this quest is ALL ABOUT that. \n\n  Level 9 is available to you from the beginning. In fact, it's not even that far from where you start. However, Level 9 is still Level 9, and still as hellish as ever (And also twice as big!!) It's essentially a long road of endurance. \n\n So you can go in Level 9. But can you beat it? Well, assuming you have a sword and a bow, you can IN THEORY meet the Silver arrow on your way through and kill Ganon with just those. But you'll probably die instead. A lot. \n\n  So, here's the catch!! There are eight dungeons dedicated to eight items, plus a ton of stuff scattered around the overworld. If death just isn't you, you're gonna have to do some questing.  \n\n  The game also uses a system of statues. The Triforce doesn't play any real role in this quest, but as an item will allow you to whistle warp to these statues after you walk into them once. There are eight statues (duh) on the overworld, and if you die in an area of the overworld, you will be returned to this statue, instead of starting way back at the beginning. \n\n\n...oh, and Link talks. nyahahahaha     Also, You'll notice I have pink lava. It's mysterious!!!    AHAHAHAHAHA",
    "story": "Things have been quiet in the big cities and towns around Hyrule, and Ganon has been missing for a few months now. \n\n   Link and Zelda were about to do some work fixing up the kingdom when they received word from a sentry that several monsters were seen surrounding a castle, kinda in the middle of nowhere. Nobody seemed to care a whole lot, given that they didn't really bug people, but it didn't sit right at all with Link. or Zelda. \n\n   Zelda sent Link to the boring town to investigate. The town and the land surrounding it may be in the middle of nowhere, but there is a bright and colorful city located in the high mountains, quite away from it. It has some good supplies, but the little town has...       well, it has next to nothing. This is unfortunate, but Link must endeavor, and with no idea what Ganon is doing, he must Get in Level 9 and stop Ganon as quickly as he safely can, which may be a pretty long time.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Since you need it to kill Ganon anyways, I'll tell you that the bow dungeon is deep in the forest to the west of town. \n\n  Also, since the dungeons in this game do not have Triforce pieces as a goal, the compass markers are used for other things, like dungeon solutions, special item locations, etc. If a dungeon has you confused, LOOK FOR THE COMPASS!!

    "description": "The long-awaited (at least by me) and often-delayed sequel of Bikdip's Adventure is finally completed! Please don't let the crappiness of the first quest deter you from trying this one out. It was my first quest, and I didn't really know what I was getting into. This one is infinitely better in all aspects. It features all of the following:\n\n* 9 Complete Levels, each with a distinct theme - some standard dungeon, some sidescrolling, and some \"other\"\n* Cutscenes to progress the plot - they don't appear until after Level 6, but there are several of them at the end\n* Connectivity with the first Bikdip's Adventure\n* A noteworthy plot with several twists along the way \n* A Bonus Level that you can unlock on the title screen\n* Lots of hidden secrets\n* And it was (mostly) made in the primitive ZC 1.90! I made the decision early on to make the quest in 1.90 because I wanted to prove that even with old software, games can still be made interesting and fun to play. It's just like how the original Zelda (and other NES games) could be great even with limited technology. However, due to technical difficulties, the quest had to be split into two segments. After beating the first, you will find a url that tells you where to get the second. The second part is to be played in 1.92 b 183 if possible.\n\nPlease don't judge the whole quest by the beginning. It was made three years ago and may not feature all the interesting tricks and such that are in the later parts of the quest. That is not to say it starts out badly, or boring, but keep in mind it gets better. Also refrain from rating the quest until you get through most or all of it, and don't rate it a 0 because you hated a certain, small part of it. That isn't fair.\n\nThis quest is best played in 1.90. I strongly suggest you play it with that version unless your computer absolutely cannot run it. If that is the case, 1.92 is bearable. 2.10 is completely out of the question. You will encounter SEVERE bugs if you use 2.10. For later beta and alpha versions, use them at your own risk - I have not tested any.\n\nA lengthy readme included in the download should answer most of your questions. I suggest that you read it, or at least skim through most of it. If you want specific information about how the different ZC versions run the quest, need help with a level or the game in general, want to know where an item is, or just read about the quest's history, the readme is your friend.\n\nThe contents of the ZIP file are as follows:\n* BA2_EB.qst - the quest itself\n* BA2.sav - a .sav file with BA1 beaten for those who didn't / don't want to play that quest. Rename your current SAV file to something else, then rename this one \"zelda.sav\" to use it without overwriting your old one.\n* The readme file - should be viewed in Notepad.",
    "story": "The main character of this game is named Bargo, and he is a Bikdip, which is basically a three-eyed happy face.\n\nBefore the first Bikdip's Adventure, he was on a journey with some other Strange Creatures when he suddenly appeared in this new world. He had no idea what was going on other than a few strange thoughts he suddenly had. \"Collect the Triforce Pieces ... Save Zelda ... Defeat Ganon...\" He didn't know what any of this meant, but he traveled through the world, solving puzzles and killing monsters, completing all three of those things. This world was at peace and he could return home, right?\n\nWrong. Ganon had miraculously managed to survive. He used the last of his power to knock out Bargo, freeze Zelda to the spot, and scatter the pieces of the Triforce once again. Completely weakened, he stole all of Bargo's possessions and went into hiding.\n\nBargo awoke, still next to Zelda at the end of the final dungeon. He knows that if he ever wants to get home, he has to revive Zelda. So now his quest picks up where it left off, and he must find all the Triforce Pieces again and defeat Ganon for good.\n\nFollowing Level 6, you will view a cutscene that unveils Ganon's schemes. He is slowly making a triumphant return, and a new villain is introduced. Your overall goal in the quest will be quite different from then on.

If you finish the game 100%, you will be rewarded for your efforts. (Getting 100% does not necessarily mean finding all the Heart Pieces, or even the cheat code)\n\nLevel 5 is a large maze. It is possible to view the in-game map there, but some versions of ZC will crash if you open the map twice in one playthrough. Because of this, you may want to create your own map out of screenshots while playing it.",

The overworld is segmented with each segment having its own music and palette, then there are more of such additions, but everything stays Classic style.

If not, however, 2.5 should be fully tested and working.\n\nThis quest took me quite a while to complete, and I'm actually quite pleased with the result. It's a classic-styled quest which started off in version 1.90 and got upgraded around the time I hit the third level.\n\nI've compiled an archive of tracker files for this quest which greatly enhances the experience. For those on slower connections or computers, don't despair! The quest still has a high quality MIDI soundtrack, as well.\n\nAs of V1.1 on July 27th, 2016, I've opted to package the trackers with the quest in hopes it'd get more people using them, as it seems like most people just run with the MIDI soundtrack. You can still grab the module files at this link. You will need an archive reader that supports the RAR format to export these songs. If you want the quest file without any trackers, you can grab it here.\n\nIf you're stuck in Level 8 with no hope of escape, replace your quest file with this one. It should fix the issue. (Make sure to redownload the trackers, though, as Level 5's song has changed as well!)",

Before you read on any further or download the quest, I want you to all understand this, THIS IS A WARM UP QUEST, which means I am not going all out on anything and everything in Zelda Classic, I'm saving the best of my abilities for the rest of my quests. The whole purpose of this quest is so I can get used to working in ZQuest again for the BIG quests. Do not expect this quest to be my best work, it will not, especially when I'm restricting myself from editing the BS 3.1 set a lot which is already somewhat restrictive in itself. Alas, I expect you guys to play and enjoy my quest for I'm mainly focusing on design and little details of every screen. Trust me, you'll notice a level of detail you don't normally see from quest makers, or for that matter in the BS 3.1 tileset, but I digest. Please enjoy my first quest, made for the public. ",
    "story": "There's is no real storyline per se'. I decided to use the usual Zelda story because it never fails and can be worked around to the quest makers will.\nThis time Link is off to find the 3 sections of the Triforce: Courage, Power, and Wisdom, to stop Ganon from once again taking over Hyrule and to rescue Zelda. You are in a different location of Hyrule this time around, in western Hyrule also known as Tinville's section of Hyrule where it's a little warmer and a now defunct mining company was the ruler of the area. Don't worry, there aren't much differences from the Hyrule you're all used to. Basically, Link's in a new section of Hyrule, has to gather the three sections of the Triforce, and save the princess. Got it? Okay then.",

Move some graves. (Do not drop in front of enemies!)\n\n7) If you have a really keen eye, in the quest there are many different easter eggs and tributes to the original Legend of Zelda, such as some people give a variance of the famous line \"It's a secret to everyone.\"",

That's fine; 2.50 runs it just as well!\n\nWARNING\nQuest contains suggestive text strings and \"jokes\" that may not be appropriate for a younger audience. Some things in the quest could even potentially be construed as stereotypical or bigoted, albeit on a very mild scale. Most probably won't agree with that notion, but I advise against playing this if you are easily offended.\n\n\nUPDATE (06-10-13)Aesthetical changes; some palette tweaks, cleaner sprite flashing, and tidier-looking water.Game icon changed from the white pill to resemble a more traditional ibuprofen tablet.Item dungeon rearranged to a symmetrical layout.\nUPDATE (04-03-10)Re-enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot, because without that enabled, you can't reflect magic with the fire boomerang! Oops!\nUPDATE (04-02-10)Tweaked the DMap title of the last dungeon. Wait, to what? I just forgot the hyphen in it!Changed the game icons to resemble a typical white-capsule pill.Zelda 3-styled boomerang/hookshot disabled; items no longer get \"pulled\" to you by those items, but rather, they're instantly acquired when the item touches it.Other small adjustments: Nudged Link's horizontal walking, blue potion resembles half-full red, slight green/red tweak in the forest palette, small volume boost to \"Dark Werld\", removed floor borders around the lava in the first block-puzzle room of the final dungeon, ...and removed one bat from a screen in the third dungeon.\nUPDATE (08-18-09)Was an error in which you could get stuck in the third dungeon. Fixed.\n\nThis quest was inspired by a 3-hour quest concept by Aslion, but was primarily inspired by Rambly's I Hate Mayonnaise. Sadly, I ended up taking about 30-40 hours to create it because I'm slow, and I get sidetracked often. Not to mention I actually bothered with detail. Ironically, I used 1.90-style mountains, and the quest is only about two hours long. \n\nIt is named after an inflammation-reducing pill, which I happened to have a container of on my desk at the time. Being the first thing I saw when trying to think of a name, that's what I decided to go with. The name is not relevant to the quest otherwise.\n\nIt's about average difficulty, but spikes in the last dungeon.",

    "tipsAndCheats": "Each and every dungeon has two secret rooms (sans the item dungeon, which contains one). Both of these rooms are 10-rupee rooms and one that contains an optional item, respectively. There are no blatant hints on-screen as how to obtain these, but that's not an issue if you keep this in mind: The secret rooms in conjunction with the displayed map make the dungeon shape symmetrical. All of these items are completely optional, but they will make the game much easier. And for clarification, there is a secret room in the optional dungeon before the final, but the rule of symmetry does not apply in this case.If a concealed entrance on the overworld looks a bit too simple to uncover, you probably shouldn't go inside.There are a total of 12 hearts in this quest.Every B-button item slot can be filled. There is no blue candle, or regular arrows.The Lens of Truth drains rupees.Equipment obtainable includes: White/magic/master swords, magic book, flippers, blue/red/gold rings, magic/mirror shields, power bracelet, ladder, and boots. You begin with the small wallet and the \"letter\".The level 1 cheat is hidden in the quest. I will not disclose what it is, or where it is located.And for those whom didn't know already, if the quest author has enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot rule, the magic boomerang blocks magic, and the fire boomerang reflects it. To tell if this rule is enabled, items will be \"pulled\" back to you when they make contact with the boomerang or hookshot. If they're instantly acquired, the rule is off. The rule is enabled in this quest. Please don't forget it!",

    "description": "..yes, you read that right. There's several little things that Link's first Gameboy outing has in common with the original Zelda, and it was with that concept in mind that I took 2.10's default tileset and pushed it.It seems to be a theme with me that I can never make ANYTHING purely in 1st: there's always a color modification or a redrawn sprite... In the case of this quest, several (but not all) palettes were dulled down a bit, giving the game a sort of \"minty\" feel, like what you'd find playing the original game on a Super Game Boy/Game Boy Player/GBC (not the DX version!) This was done both to go along with the theme of Link's Awakening, and to make the quest just a little easier on the eyes.The game retains its story, although the drama doesn't build up quite as much as it should. To make up for this, the final battle sets itself upon a crumbling platform as the sun sets and Koholint slowly fades away. Link, you're a bastard.Overall, this quest is kind of a workshop of sorts. Unencoded, it can be played through, or you can do with it as you please in ZQuest. It's a sort of Skeleton (Stalfos?) quest. UPDATE: MaximusFred has gone through the quest for himself and painstakingly removed several of the errors people so graciously discovered. IF YOU GOT THIS QUEST BEFORE, YOU MAY BE ENTITLED TO A CLASS ACTION LAWSU-download it again. This has become not an Old-Skool quest so much as an Old-Skool/MaximusFred quest now.",

    "description": "Sometime after the original version of Neverending Fantasy was released, I wanted to make a simpler-structured quest that had a ZC newcomer-friendly feel to it. I say this because, at the time, I noticed a lot of quests were really confusing without any real sense of direction, even at the very beginning for their own good, often to the point of shutting off my attention all-together. That being said, however, the difficulty does start to pick up around Level 4, and even gave me a run for my money around Level 7, so it should be playable even for ZC veterans. This quest features a standard sized overworld with 9 main dungeons, 2 secret dungeons, and quite a few elusive secrets abound. As for the changes made to 2.5, this should be it here:-Ganon can now be beaten in 2.5!-Enhanced music replacing MIDIs-BS Zelda sfx-Some minor screen changes-Boss HP has been tampered with-Trap and Zora damage output has been upped-Uses new text font-Some quest rules changed to fix some glitches-Tons of hidden rupee secretsMAJOR UPDATE!- New puzzles and key placements made in the dungeons to make them more challenging!- Caves are a bit tougher to navigate- Biggest Wallet and extra bomb upgrade are now in the game- Total heart pieces bumped from 16 to 20- Every dungeon now has a heart piece aside from the secret ones- Some graphical tile fixes- More typos squashedUPDATE 6/21/15:- Fixed bait cave bugUPDATE 7/7/15- Fixed jank block puzzle in level 2- Fixed some of the block sfxUPDATE 7/31/15- Music updated to where names are a lot less generic- Music changed for levels 4, 9, Death Mountain and Final Boss- Some vague hints added to help player in confusing puzzles- Fire Gleok has been nerfedUPDATE 8/1/15:- Some minor balances made to Level 9- Heart Container now has a unique pickup soundUPDATE 1/26/17:- Minor aesthetical changes to tile placement- block puzzle in Kakariko cave made less obnoxious- overall, if you've beaten the game at this point, not really worth playing again for this minor update as it's merely just a polish touch-up.",
    "story": "So Ganon's been dead for some time, and a remnant of his army and high general, Synrilla, aims to revive his fallen master. Legend has it that it requires the sacrifice of one the bearers of the Triforce pieces. Given the Triforce of Courage has been lost for centuries, he aims for Zelda, given she still has the Triforce of Wisdom. However, in order to spare Zelda's life, Zelda told Synrilla of the hidden pieces of the Triforce of Courage, the legendary Hero and line of descendants who has slayed Ganon in the past. A remnant of that Hero, Link, lived deep within the Woods of Tatl, and Zelda made a bargain with Synrilla that if Link were to get to hidden pieces of the Triforce of Courage, and bring them to Hyrule Castle, he would post-pone Zelda's death sentence in return for Ganon having both the Triforce pieces for the ultimate revival. Of course, Zelda has faith that Link can defeat Synrilla, and stop Ganon's revival, so upon summoning Link through telepathy, Link begins the ultimate gamble of a quest!",
    "tipsAndCheats": "There are 20 HC pieces total. Every dungeon except for the bonus dungeons have one.

Because I was slow to get the news, I had little time to submit a version myself, yet I still wanted to try.\n\nHowever, I found a few of the rules for the official fourth quest contest to be a little restricting for me.  These were mostly aesthetic issues, such as graphics and music, but some involved gameplay elements as well.  Fortunately, by continuing on without the rules in mind, I was able to create alternate versions of the original quests with new tiles, extra music, and some extra gameplay tweaks.\n\nIn general, mapmaking is not one of my strengths; but I am not that bad of a dungeon builder.  Therefore, this quest is an alternate version of the first quest.\n\nI played this quest myself extensively and am certain everything is working right.  If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n**UPDATE 1/5/11**\nI added some new tiles and combos to improve the aesthetics, including Zelda II grass (non-mowable); made minor changes in some dungeon layouts; added a few more secrets; and, by popular demand, reduced the number of \"Door Repair\" charges.

Its just a solid, dungeon crawling Zelda game that shouldn't take too long to complete.  I'm particularly proud of it though, mainly because of the attention to detail that I put into it.  I'd like to thank Sludge, the creator of the Cooldungeon tileset.  I loved working with it.  It was easy to use and had a lot of good tiles.  Thanks to Warlock for his sprites for the newfirst tileset.  There were a couple other guys that had made sprites that I used.

It's quite big for a first quest (9 dungeons, 3 overworlds, 24 heart containers, 1 extra dungeon, more than I can count bomb upgrades and lots of hidden money). I learned while making it so from the 1st to the 3rd dungeon its pretty basic Zelda stuff. After that is where the game really takes off. I used the original Zelda graphics because I didn't want anything flashy for a first game. But don't let that blind your judgment. If you have criticism, only post it if it's constructive and you have gotten past level 5.(That's where the game really shines). Mostly bug free. You can finish the game of course but there aren't any big bugs that will stop you. (Tested by my brother)Music is my choice so if you don't like it sorry. Overall, It's my first game( of many more to come) and have a blast!

I have tested this game many times and to my knowledge there are no bugs at all. But what it all comes down to is this.

The tileset used was a very strange choice. You may recognize this from PolygonX8's (Exate) \"A Link to the Darkness 5\". Why I ever chose that tileset I don't know. This quest was initially a test of day to night transitions but it transformed quite quickly. A majority of this quest was worked on when I was 15. At the time I wasn't too mature, so some dialogue may seem cheesy, if not all of it. But that's what I think is the best part. The dialogue is like something you'd get out of an early 90's RPG...But this quest was my attempt to make a Zquest with a decent story, and show you players to not care so much about a great tileset. I do know how to do just about everything in Zquest, which you may not see right away. But I think this is one of those quests you should take a look at and try before you see a screenshot and say \"pass\". I was inspired a lot by Illusion of Gaia, the way heart pieces are obtained are like the red jewels. If you don't get a heart piece at a certain time, you'll never be able to get it again. So it keeps you checking areas if you want them all. There isn't tons of exploration, just like there isn't in Illusion of Gaia. Speaking of which, after I finished almost all of the quest, I played Terranigma and noticed some resemblances in the story... kind of. But anyway, enjoy if you choose to try this.",
    "story": "Once upon a time, a boy named Link was born in the kingdom of Hyrule. He grew up with his parents in Kakariko Village. They were explorers, and would take link exploring often. Some locations were dangerous, but it didn't bother them. Link would sometimes worry in his childhood where they would go, and if they were safe. In the spare time, Link would stay with his grandfather who would often take Link around caves, as he had a love for them. Link had a happy childhood, but things took a turn for the worse at the age of eleven. His parents disappeared, and many villagers rumored them to be dead. No one knew for sure. Link and his grandfather were not able to live in Kakariko Village anymore, they were too poor, and didn't want the townspeople talking about the incident, so they stayed in a cave north of the village. At the age of thirteen, it was announced that princess Zelda of Hyrule Castle was kidnapped. Link always felt after his parents left, there was nothing for him anymore, he couldn't live the same again. So he set out to rescue this princess, not caring the dangers that might face him. But what is he really getting himself into...?",

    "description": "This is my very first quest I have made, using the Classic Tileset with version 2.10. It took awhile to make this, even though I kinda just made it up as I went along, but I assure you this quest will give a good challenge to Zelda Classic players.\n\nThe quest is best played on version 2.10. I have not tested this game in 2.5, so thus if any bugs occur when playing on 2.5, please play on 2.10. Grammar is good, and there are no bugs to be seen, though if you do encounter any while playing, please let me know and I will fix them ASAP.\n\nI made this game to somewhat play like a classic NES-style Zelda game, though much like Oracle of Seasons, the game emphasizes on fighting a lot rather than puzzles, though this quest has a few that, while not head-scratching, will keep the gameplay fresh, or at least I am hoping. The quest provides the staple 9 dungeons to complete, plus several side dungeons you'll go through along the way.\n\nI hope you all enjoy my first quest!\n\nEDIT: Fixed a bug. Beforehand, if you went back to a Triforce room after getting the Triforce, you'd be stuck. I fixed that with adding in a portal in the Triforce room so you can leave easily.\nEDIT 2: Added respawn points in the Triforce rooms should people go back to them and save there. This should solve the issue of people suddenly vanishing in said rooms when they restart the game from there. Hopefully this should be the last bug fix for this. Sorry for any inconvenience!",
    "story": "One day in Hyrule, Link was out fishing, relaxing after saving his homeland once again. As he laid about, however, he began to hear a voice, calling out for his help. Oddly, the voice came from the lake, and Link soon found himself pulled into it's waters, going unconscious. When he awoke, he found himself in an unfamiliar place.\n\nLink later finds out he's on the distant continent of Elmingarde, which is under siege by an evil warlock. Seeing no other option, Link sets out to free this land and release the seal on Elmingarde's goddess, Solaria.",

    "description": "Two years ago, ZeldaClassic.com held a contest for an official fourth quest to be included in the release version of Zelda Classic 2.5. Because I was slow to get the news, I had little time to submit a version myself, yet I still wanted to try.\n\nHowever, I found a few of the rules for the official fourth quest contest to be a little restricting for me. These were mostly aesthetic issues, such as graphics and music, but some involved gameplay elements as well. Fortunately, by continuing on without the rules in mind, I was able to create alternate versions of the original quests with new tiles, extra music, and some extra gameplay tweaks.\n\nAfter creating DaDoc540's 1st Quest Remix, I decided to create a remix of the second quest, which is what I present to you here.  The dungeon locations are mostly different from those of Doc's 1st, requisite items are harder to both locate and obtain, and more traps and hazards reside in the dungeons.  The difficulty curve of this quest is certainly steeper than the last one, but not too steep.  You have been warned…\n\nI played this quest myself extensively and am certain everything is working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can.\n\n**WARNING!**\nThis quest is more difficult than the previous one, so do not try this quest under the following circumstances:\n-You do not have the experience of completing various quests of high difficulty.\n-You have trouble fighting certain difficult enemies, namely Blue Darknuts and Wizzrobes.  (Only classic enemies are used here.)\n-You have great difficulty in finding hidden secrets.\n-You have Wile E. Coyote syndrome (i.e. unable to quit something until you complete it)\n\nPlease do not rate this quest with a score based solely on the difficulty.  If you can handle the difficulty, this should provide a worthwhile challenge.\n\n**Update**  vravelo brought my attention to a major bug in Level 9 that can trap the player.  The bug should be removed.  My apologies!",

    "tipsAndCheats": "You will be without a sword at the beginning for a short time.  Listen to the advice of the Old Man at the first screen to find both the first dungeon and your first sword.\n\nWait until you obtain your first sword before you save.  If something happens that prevents you from obtaining the first sword, select \"Retry\" from the Continue menu and try again.\n\nMake sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.  Also note the consequences of pushing a block in a certain direction; a push the wrong way could block you from reaching the passageway.\nNote: It should be impossible to completely seal yourself in such a way that forces you to reset.\n\nAlways make sure you have found every requisite item from each dungeon.  You often need an item in one dungeon to either enter or complete a future dungeon.\n\nVisit Info booths for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items, namely Sword upgrades, and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.",

I was heavily inspired by the Oracle of Ages / Seasons for this game.\n\nThe game features two complete overworlds (one in past and present) as well as several connecting areas. There are 9 main dungeons each with its own unique theme as well as 3 optional, but recommended, dungeons known as the Dungeons of Trials. There are numerous secrets in the game.\n\nThis quest was built in version 2.10 and played and tested in 2.10.2. I have had the game tested and I also played through it twice, so hopefully there are no game-stopping errors, but if there is, just let me know and I will fix it asap. \n\nI hope the community enjoys my first quest. \n\nUpdate: 3/26/11\n- Reduced the prices on info guys and in shops.\n- Made it possible to move blocks in West Shrine without killing enemies.\n- Certain trees weren't solid.\n- Moved Gibdo spawns during Level 3's boss.\n\nUpdate: 3/27/11\n- Fixed an error that made it impossible to find Level 7.\n\nUpdate: 4/13/11\n- Fixed the issues involving Whistle -> Stair waterwalking.\n- Small fix to Glyco Woods to make the secrets more uniform.\n- Changed Level 7's boss\n- Fixed a few minor issues in Glyco Village, The Tower of Time and North Shrine.",

ZCRealm was the only site to get this quest for a while, as I did not feel as if its style was suited for the general ZC audience. However, if you follow ElectrometerPrime's LPs, you may have seen video of this quest.\n\nHowever, with the passing of ZCR (Well, it'll be gone when 2012 hits, anyway), I figured I'd submit the quest here - while it's certainly not on the level of A Link to the Shadows, I find it worthwhile enough to at least spread around.\n\nKeep in mind, however, this quest is not insanely polished or very big - I did create it in a mere three hours, after all! Either way, hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it! It's three dungeons (and one mini-dungeon) long, and contains a cave system and a small overworld. Make sure you explore places thoroughly to find everything. It may be a bit easy, as you become quite powerful quite quickly in this quest.\n\n(Sadly, this quest has no tracker package to go along with it - I simply lacked the time to fit such music to the quest, let alone very atmospheric music period.)",

It's a spiritual sequel to the first I Hate Mayonnaise, although it really doesn't share much in common with that quest beyond the tileset and overall atmosphere. It's far longer and there's way more to do.\n\nThere are 5 dungeons and many more minidungeons. It probably won't take you too long to beat -- roughly 6-7 hours on the first playthrough, and that's if you bother to retrieve everything.\n\nThis was originally intended to be a sister quest to Exate's Pessimistic Pizza, hence the title, and they were meant to come out around the same time. However, due to delays in both quests development, that plan didn't work out.\n\nThis quest was mostly designed in 2.10, so it mostly sticks to that version's features. There's not much in terms of scripts or new mechanics in this quest. I mostly just focused on design. And the pretty colors.\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\nLast updated: 02/16/2016.

Not only is this a very fast way to accumulate money (which you will need) and keep your health high, but many things are hidden in the grass.\n\n• When you get the whistle, the warp ring takes you to: The potion shop, the wand shop, the southwestern most screen in Canyonero, and the entrance to Shiptown Township. You can take advantage of this to quickly get potions late in the game.\n\n• For your reference, large crystals must have magic directed towards them in order to cause a reaction. Smaller gems embedded in blocks require *reflected* magic (ie. with the mirror shield).\n\n• There's a few NPCs in Shiptown Township that offer useful advice, and you can purchase the blue ring and other things there (also, the raft, a required item, is only obtainable there). The entrance to there is in the southernmost section of Festivity Fields.\n\n• There are five heart containers scattered around the world in addition to the four you get from boss fights. You may also retrieve three higher level swords beyond the Splinter Sword you start off with, and there are large rupee amounts hidden in various caves. Exploration is good, so be sure to look around!\n\n• You can get the Lens of Truth as soon as you get the Red Candle (Sunny B. Light). I'm not gonna point out specifically where, but if you find it, you can basically break the game wide open.\n\n• I'd recommend bringing a pen and paper to level 4 -- it's quite a bit more confusing than I'd hoped it would end up being.

I also fixed tons of bugs, enhancements, and whatnot.\n\n1.2.5 Update (5/30/12): I added a little more screen improvements and a new custom boss, but I think I'll call it quits for the foreseeable future, and work on new projects rather than touching up this one.\n\n1.2.6.2 Update (7/14/12): When I said I was calling it quits, I meant I wouldn't re-do the overworlds and all that. I will continue to fix bugs (as I did for this update), though. Oh, and I replaced the Light World palette/music with those of the now-removed 'Light World Alt' DMap.\n\n1.2.7 Update (10/16/12): Fixed a lot more bugs.\n\n1.2.7.1 Update (10/31/12): Made the clues for one of my most confusing puzzles more obvious.",

Somewhere along the line I forgot that I was doing a simple bugfix and added a ton of new features. Since this was one of my earlier ventures into scripting, I didn't want to modify the old code...actually I was just lazy. As a result, all of the new stuff was scripted without the use of modern resources like ghost.zh and any lag issues may not be fixed entirely. I tried to clean out some of the old code, but I could only tolerate so much.\nFeatures new to this update:A brand new goofy bonus dungeon filled with brand new enemies and brand new desperation attacksA brand new goofy bonus bossA brand new ending that's just as goofy as the bonus dungeon and bossA new power for an old itemBoss names on health barsA new custom subscreenVarious bugfixes and tweaks\n\n[UPDATE 7/16/19] Apparently despite this being quite an old quest, people are still playing it for some reason. After watching one too many streams of people suffering to some of the more questionable decisions, I finally decided to make the easy and obvious fixes. Took me long enough.The quest tells you about the mouse control element at the start. You're also no longer dumped in a room full of enemies.The Zora boss has been nerfed to be doable without aimed shot.Goddess Band is now on the fast item cycle, preventing some obnoxious inventory stuff in the bonus dungeon. It looks a little strange but it's functionally better.Demon hearts should now disappear after getting Goddess Band.All red bubbles have been removed and replaced with temporary ones.Boss refights no longer respawn.A few very minor layout changes in dungeons to make some stuff less confusing and avoid some time wastes.Mirror wizzrobes die in one hit and one of them has been removed.

    "description": "After finishing my latest classic quest remixes, I thought I was finished with the Classic Overworld. While I remain most devoted to the Classic tileset, I was intent on creating a wholy new quest, as a Classic Overworld can only be used so many times.\n\nIt was when I realized that many, if not most, Classic Overworld quests (with varying tilesets) were of a single layer that I realized that one can still add depth to a Classic Overworld quest with one tweak: multiple layers. In this case, I took the original, Classic Overworld, restuctured it with my version of a Classic graphics pack (namely palette, tiles, and combos), and added multiple layers to create taller trees, larger boulders, fences for bridges, microblocks in dungeons, etc. I hope with this quest, one can see the potential of any good tileset, so long as one uses layering to add depth to an otherwise single layer map.\n\nCompared to my previous two quests based off of the Original Classic Overworld, the difficulty should be manageable to most people.\n\nAs usual, I played this quest myself thoroughly and am certain everything should be working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can. Also, I will continue to aesthetically update this quest as new tiles become available.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n(Update 7/18/12): Filled in an empty cave Artistic discovered; improved aesthetics, primarily of grassy, wooded areas.\n\n(Update 7/29/12): Lowered the rupee amount of some \"Secret Money\" rooms to reduce chance of overflow; added and improved more aesthetics, most notably the addition of stone walkways (as seen on screenshot 10).\n\n(Update 8/13/12): Removed enemies from an in-dungeon shop (No more unruly \"customers\"!); further minor aesthetic improvements.\n\n(MAJOR UPDATE 2/5/13): After three months of work, First Quest Layered is now formatted for version 2.50. While the general structure of this quest has remained the same, the items and enemies have changed. True Arrows are used (with Arrow ammunition and counter), and both quiver and bomb bag upgrades are available. While most of the enemies maintain most or all of their previous traits and behaviors, some have been totally revamped. Plus, new enemies not present in the previous update have been added.\n\nEven if you have played this quest before in its 2.10 version, I highly recommend that you give this new version a try. Make sure you have Zelda Classic 2.50 to run it through. I hope you enjoy it as much as the older version.\n\n(Update 5/20/13): Minor improvement of aesthetics.\n\n(Update 7/17/13): Addition of new enemies, most notably the Stalchild and the Helmasaur. Look out for the former in the Graveyard. Also, Gels, Chuchus, and Zols act like the new Gibdos, using Eat (Damage) touch effects, but still require one hit to split or kill.\n\n(Update 12/24/13): Overhaul of dungeon wall aesthetics, slight changes to some dungeon rooms to involve more item use.",
    "story": "The Triforce of Courage has been split into eight fragments, each hidden away in different underground labyrinths of Hyrule and guarded by formidable creatures. Only a Hero courageous, wise, and strong enough can reclaim the eight fragments and reassemble the Triforce of Courage to prove oneself worthy to challenge Ganon, the King of Thieves, who has been wreaking havoc upon the once prosperous Hyrule. Are you the one?",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Make sure you have attempted to push everything movable. Blocks cannot be pushed into solid items and sometimes have to be pushed in the right direction.\n\nThe five loose Heart Containers (i.e. those not dropped by slain dungeon bosses) have been split into twenty Heart Pieces. Most are scattered and hidden throughout the overworld, but be on the lookout for a few hidden in dungeons as well.\n\nVisit Info booths around the Overworld and Old Men in dungeons for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.\n\nWhile this is not as difficult as my previous two quests, the end can still be a challenge. Unless you have impeccable memory, I suggest players to write down notes, sketches, etc. when exploring the later dungeons. You do not want to forget where one-way shutters are located!\n\nVersion 2.50:\nRemember that, unlike in the original Legend of Zelda, your Arrows are limited, so conserve them for enemies that require Arrows for defeat (e.g. Gohma, Ganon). Enemies weak to Arrows, such as Tektites, and enemies that fire Arrows, namely Moblins, drop Arrows when defeated. There are Quiver upgrades in addition to Bomb Bag upgrades hidden throughout dungeons.\n\nWhile most of the enemies are the same as before, others have been changed dramatically. Four notable examples are the Lynel, the Gel, the Zol, the Gibdo, and the Pols Voice. New enemies, such as the Helmasaur, are also present.\n-Lynels no longer pause to shoot fire blasts and will charge at you upon sight.\n-Gels, Chuchus, and Zols all cling onto you to feed off of your vitality, but still require one hit to split or kill.\n-Gibdos can now grab onto you and drain your vitality until destroyed.\n-Pols Voice are no longer very weak to arrows but can be instantly killed with something else; however, the Ocarina (Whistle) is not effective enough to injure the ears.\n-Being smaller than Darknuts, Helmasaurs have less vitality but are shielded on all sides except its back. If running or sneaking behind it proves too difficult or unreliable, a well placed bomb will work.",

Also changed the 10 Mirrorobe room into only 5 instead, and removed the 'Enemies always return' rule. Added MP3s and NSF music and also introduced free-movement.UPDATE 5:Kind of a big update. Nerfed a few enemies and changed some MIDIs around.UPDATE 6:Fixed a bug in the overworld and finally removed the horrific screech from the Zubats. In addition, I also balanced Boss and most enemy HP to reasonable amounts so that they won't drag on forever. And I also made the Patra 4 more manageable.UPDATE 7:Fixed a gamebreaking bug where you can run out of arrows after the fight with Aganhim and then you won't be able to proceed.

Instead of running around, solving dungeons and saving the world, you get to run around, shooting and slashing hordes of enemies into oblivion. The game is divided into levels, which you can revisit from the main hub. All of the game's 16 items can be bought in a centralized shop, where you can find the best selection of equipment for your fighting style.So what are you waiting for?! Download now and start blowing stuff up!Main features:9 unique levels of mayhem!A scripted scoring system to encourage replayability (and practice your mad skills)!4 categories of all-scripted weapons (12 total) to choose from!A working, side-scrolling space level!Ultra-powerful hidden bosses, guarding an additional 4 weapons to collect!And... a jaw-droppingly awesome main characterThis game has an enhanced music file that plays in the last level. For legal reasons, PureZC can't host that file in the quest database. To get it, search for \"megaman x8 jakob download\" to find the MP3, and then put it in the same folder as the .qst file or the ZC executable, and call it \"CIS LVL9 MP3.mp3\". If you don't do this, an ordinary MIDI will play in its place. If you can't or don't want to find it yourself, you can send me a PM and I'll give you a link to the file.11/11/12: Added an opening cutscene that almost explains what's going on, and fixed a few bugs and a typo or two.11/26/12: More semi-important updates.12/12/12: Fixed the enemy respawn bug and un-blocked a door that should not have been blocked.5/31/13: New game-over and level complete animations, less un-hittable Neo-Gohmoid, plus minor tweaks.",

    "description": "This is one of the longest quests I've worked on! I'm still not done making the game! This is the completed first quest!\n\nIn The Light Within you play as the fallen demonlord Sora. Your objective is to find and destroy the 6 Balls of Light in order to unlock the final level of Pencil Tower and defeat your light side! If we consider 1 hour 3 months, or 1 season, you have 4 hours or 1 game year to complete this task on normal mode (My recommended difficulty). Time really doesn't matter, but it adds a fun new challenge to the game. Depending on how hard the game already is, I may or may not change the time limits! My best time is 3:23:36. I haven't speed run this quest because it would involve sequence breaking, LUCK, and skipping many items. Heart containers and pieces are a must in this game if you want to beat it! You can have 20 hearts in total, 4 different defence rings (immortality ring not availible in final dungeon), 3 Roc's feather levels (L1 only in final dungeon), Low and high level dins fire (L1 only in final dungeon), short and long hookshots, 5 different swords including the broken blade, and you can buy up to 6 potions (3 in the beginning) from the potion shop girl, Arukas.\n\nThere will be a 2.0 release later on that will have the 1st quest with extras not availible in this release, and a 2nd quest availible with a similar, yet eerily different overworld, stronger enemies, altered dungeons and altered locations, 3 ruins at old locations, extra story (taking place about a year later), and items and upgrades left unused (or are 2nd quest only)!\n\nUpdate 1: The old version was buggy and I didn't mean to release that version.\n\nUpdate 2: I also fixed the warping to the entrance to the master sword battle from dying in the mirror shield room, The respawn room will warp you back to Arukas's house.\n\nUpdate 3: The Final Gauntlet's block puzzle segment is now easier since you can go to the room before, and the tiles the blocks are supposed to go on are brighter, but you will have to redo the block puzzle from the room you walk back to because the rooms reset and I can't fix that...",
    "story": "WARNING: LONG STORY!\n\nReach Mana (Weapon: Grappling Hook) of the Mountainican Noble lineage is an athlete of the MMRL. Final race of the season he is racing his rival and best friend simply nicknamed \"Jumps\" (Weapon: Springed Boots) for the title of Champion. Near the end of the race they are both teleported to a giant nuclear bomb with a male figure floating in front of them. Reach identifies the person, but hides his knowledge. They destroy the nuke and escape. a few days later the nuke is rebuilt and headed on a crash course for Mountainica. Reach explains to Jumps that the man was Sora (Weapon: Wings), Reach's previous rival who died in a more dangerous VVRL race 2 years ago. Sora is prompt to teleport them on top of the rebuilt nuke, reveal a pair of demon horns, and fight them. After Sora was defeated, he sent them to Hell with him where Reach took his L2 sword (Satan's Bird. A 1 hit banishment on demons). When Sora was banished to the waiting room he used a spell to bring Reach's girlfriend Run (Weapon: Rocket Shoes) and Jumps's girlfriend (Reach's little sister) Itsuki (Weapon: Digging Mitts) to Hell as well. The party of 4 leave to The Hell Motel where we meet Mutoh (Weapon: Hand Shoes), the weird guy who always handstands and is Jumps's equal to Reach and Sora. Afterwards they find a grassland... in Hell? They take it as a blessing and go inside. They rest up and are about to leave when 2 demon girls: Sakura (Weapon: 2 stabbing Knives) equal to Run, and Sue (Weapon: Stilts) equal to Itsuki, cast curses on the land and leave it as barren as the rest of Hell. That in mind, Reach and Co. decide to dig their way into Satan's Castle with Itsuki's Digging Mitts. When they enter Satan's Castle each teammate is picked off 1 by 1 starting with Itsuki and Sue, then Jumps and Mutoh, then Run and Sakura, ending with a battle between Reach and Sora where Reach loses Satan's Bird. Sora is defeated and begs Satan for more power. Satan reluctantly gives him the power and pays for it with his life. Sora becomes the new demonlord and Hell turns into a real sea of flames. Things happen, everyone gets seperated, and Reach wakes up in a bed. He sees Sakura and begins to grab his Grappling hook. Before he attacks her, she reveals to him that she saved his life, she doesn't work for Sora, and she wants to help him in his fight against Sora. She makes a deal with him and becomes his servant for as long as Sora is alive. They find Run first and it leads to a slightly awkward moment. They find Itsuki with a girl named Shiro (Weapon: White Magic) and later another girl named Kuro (Weapon: Black Magic) who have healing arts and destructive arts only matched by each other. Jumps finds the island and leaps over to them. Reach tames a dragon and they go to a hot spring. at the hot spring they meet the girl Test Subject K-3 (Weapon: Mind control, brainwashing, etc.) who joins the party at 8th. They head towards Sora's Castle split into three groups and lead an offensive to take control of the outer land. Sakura teams with Shiro and Kuro, Test Subject K-3 teams with Run and Itsuki, and Jumps and Reach drop right at the front door with Mutoh waiting for them. After Mutoh is defeated, a robot zombie monster clone of Sora falls out of the sky and fights too. Sakura gets in a fight with Sue and has her demon horns ripped off. Healing items depleted, Reach calls Sakura's team and asks for them to return to the front entrance. Itsuki finds the back entrance and her team clears out the first floor. The team reunited continues towards Sora, but not before Sakura gives Reach her L1 Sword (Super finger). Sora reveals His new L3 sword (Satan's Claw) with an odd accuracy killer. They fight, Satan comes back as a Pen being who is far stronger than the Pencil beings of Reach's homeworld, and we find out Sora killed Sakura's older brother Sousuke between the times of Sora's takeover and the party seperation. The fight continues, Sora removes the accuracy killer, and he kills Reach. Reach is alive inside of his own subconcious and meets Hcaer (Weapon: Boomerang) of the Opposite Universe. They merge spirits and Reach is revived with a new sword (Repent finger) that cancels out the power of Satan's Claw. Finally Sora is defeated and drops to the floor, but it's not over yet! 2nd form Sora froze Hell he was so powerful. They defeat him  and are given a sudden death between Reach and Sora. Reach wins and we finally get to the beginning of this quest! Shortly afterward we meet Reach's father Rentetsu (Weapon: Ice picks) who dies of natural causes 15 days after Reach's 24th birthday. This all happened over the course of about 11 months. This quest starts on the 9th month.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Tip: Many small trees are bombable! If you get spin attack (and I suggest you do!) use it to find if a small tree is bombable.\n\nTip: There are many spiked roads! There are 2 ways to manage the spiked roads: Roc's feather and normal boots. I use the Roc's feather because it's a required item! There is only 1 place to find the Roc's Feather!\n\nTip: Abay is an annoyance, but he does give you awesome things!\n\nWARNING:SPOILERS\n\nMini-Walkthrough: First you'll want to get your L1 Sword. Head east until you can't head anymore east and go south then west and you'll find Pencil Tower. Inside Pencil Tower you'll be avoiding enemies and finding keys for your first visit. When you get to the first boss your sword will be right in front of you. Grab it and kill the aquamentus quickly, a heart container is in the room beyond it. After you complete the first visit you'll need bombs. The cave to get bombs is southwest of Pencil Tower on the beach. In The Crescent Moon Cave You'll avoid spiked floors and be killing a custom mid-boss known as a grabber twice. Once you get the bombs head back to the room you got the heart container in and bomb the left wall. Kill the goriyas for the map and go left. kill the darknut and get the key behind the blocks. Open the locked door and kill the wallmasters. Go right, kill the stalfos, and grab the key. Go north, kill more stalfos, and grab the boss key. DON'T go through the locked door! If you do you'll be cursed to have the L1.5 Sword (Broken blade. fires sword beams as long as you have atleast 1 full heart) until you get the magic key. Instead go to the menu, exit game, continue, and head back to the wallmaster room. go north and kill the moldorms. go left and go south. Kill the 2 aquamentus' and get the heart container. Enter the portal and kill the moldorm army for the L2 Sword. Buy your arrow from the shopkeep in town. Head east and follow the tall grass path until you reach the Pen Cave. Avoid spikes, kill enemies, and get the bow before you fight Optomon (Played as a ghoma) who will give you the silver arrow. Take the portal to fight a manhandla and get a heart container. The next portal takes you to a 12 headed gleeok which is nearly unkillable as you are. Leave and go southtoward the beach. You might want to buy the boots that keep you from getting hurt by spikes (I don't because it's not required) The Rentetsu Shrine is along the beach and on a spiked road. Run through the road (if you didn't get the boots you'll need atleast 1 potion) and enter the shrine. Now get the 1st ball of light on your own! Boss: Manhandla.",

Use zelda.nsf included in the download folder to listen to these songs. Furthermore, a bug has been fixed where you can enter Level 3's maze without the Bracelet and get stuck forcing people to F6.UPDATE 2: Nothing major, just a music change for one dungeon.UPDATE 3: Made a few changes to most enemy HP and damage to make difficulty more balanced as well as changing colours of some enemies to suit the Flashback 2nd enemy colour format.",

    "description": "Quest made in ZC 2.5.Here are facts about this quest, wich you should read before playing!!- This quest is only about fighting enemies, so if thats not for you, go away ;D- You can choose between German and English.- At the beginning you can choose one out of seven characters.- Those are Hero, Druid, Mage, Blocker, Berserc, Warlock, Ninja and theres one secret character you dont know.- Press the MAP button to return to the character selection menu!!! <- Good to know- There 6 levels and a final level.- If you loose all your HP (hearts), you die. Then you have to restart the level.- EVERY character has a sword and a magic wand. The magic wand uses MP (mana points).- EVERY character can slash.- EVERY character also has a chance to land a critical hit, wich is only for the sword attacks not the magical attacks.- No diagonal movement, this time!!- You can save whenever you want. And you should, if you take a break from the quest. When you finish the quest with one character you get a medal for that character. When you have all medals, you have finished the quest 100%!The Zip file also contains the important character table, where you can see the stats of all characters, like MP, HP, Magical Power, Sword Power, Movement, and more.The characters:-Hero- Difficulty: EasyThis is the character from the screenshot . As you can see he has lots of HP but is lacking MP and magical power. His strenght is close combat, as he can deal great damage with his sword.-Druid- Diffictulty: NormalA very balanced character, although his sword attacks are not the best. His great advantage lies in its special ability \"Natural Regeneration\", wich slowly increases his HP, permanently.-Mage- Difficulty: NormalWhile his sword attacks are really weak, his magical power is incredible! This character's strenght is ranged combat, using his magic wand he can beat all his enemies. His ability \"Recovery of Spirit\" slowly refills his MP, permanently.-Blocker- Difficulty: NormalThis mysterious character has lots of power, his sword attacks are almost as strong as the Hero's sword attacks. His magical attacks however, don't do any damage! Instead they block the enemie's movement for a short amount of time (he stuns enemies). Also, he is one of the few characters who have a shield.-Berserc- Difficulty: NormalAnother very balanced character, with a great ability. You can press L to turn on the \"Berserc-Mode\", and R to turn it off. In Berserc-Mode, your sword deals doubled damage!!, but you will instantly die if you get hit in this mode, so it's a great risk. You have to think about when you use it, and when you don't.-Warlock- Difficulty: HardThe HP and MP of the Warlock are pretty low. However, the Warlock has a helpful special ability, the \"Heart-Mana Transfer\". By pressing L or R, he can use this ability to turn 1 MP into 1 HP to heal himself, or to sacrifice 1 HP to get 1 MP at will, so he can do more magical attacks.-Ninja- Difficulty: HardThis character can run faster than all others! It is easy for him, to dodge all dangers. He also has a high chance of landing a critical hit with his sword, even though the damage bonus is not very high.UPDATE: Fixed all remaining known bugs.",
    "story": "-None-",
    "tipsAndCheats": "1) If you accidently select a wrong character in the character selection menu or want to play another character, the MAP button will always bring you right back to the character menu. You will start from level 1 again.2) Never forget to save when you stop playing! You can save whenever you want and when you beat the quest with all 7 characters, the 8. character will be unlocked. Complete the quest with him and you have 100% finished Fight the Monsters II.",

    "description": "\"Linked to the Past\" is a BIG quest that will keep you busy for a long time if you're enjoying it. In case you are wondering, it is a completely original quest, I've chosen that name because the storyline involves Link travelling to the past, and also obviously as a nod to the great SNES LttP game, but it is not a remake or anything, it is a completely new quest.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 30 different dungeons\n- 20-30 hours of gameplay\n- Every single dungeon is guarded by a custom boss, and there are also a few sub-bosses thrown in for good measure, so I hope you enjoy fighting bosses as much as I do\n- Many optional secrets to find\n- The quest takes influences from several Zelda games but the biggest influence is still Zelda 1, so if you're a Zelda 1 hater, this is probably not for you\n\nv1.79: latest adjustments and fixes",

    "description": "LQftH2 Version Lunaria.0\n\nI decided to update the quest again in response to Lunaria's rather lengthy review and address most of her complaints. In the process I ended up having a little fun and overhauling a significant portion of the quest, adding a ton of new stuff. The dungeon graphics and layouts are still the same, but there's a ton of new content added. In this update you can expect to see:New Dungeons: One of the first things I set out to do was replacing the less well received bonus dungeons with more fair ones. Moosh's Ways, Veni Vidi Vici, and Ultimate Test are still in the quest, but have been moved over to a different game setting called Legacy Mode. The same goes for Level 7 Hard Mode. On top of that, there's a completely new bonus dungeon.New Bosses: Most of the boss related stuff in this update is small tweaks to old bosses, but there's a couple new ones thrown into the mix.New Enemies: Some old dungeons have new enemies in them and some old enemies are returning with scripted tricks up their sleeves.Weapons to Surpass Metal Gear: New to this update are seven tier 5 swords. Seven. Tier 5. They're crazy. Each is based on a Zelda Classic let's player or streamer. If you're a returning player eager to see the new content, you can even use a cheat to start the game with a powered down version of one of them. And there's a few new passive items to collect on the side.A Whole New World: A new fantastic point of view! No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming...Ahem, sorry. The overworld in the original version of the quest was complete skippable trash, almost anything would be better. So I took some inspiration from NewJourneysFire's TRIFORCE which apparently took inspiration from me, and redesigned the entire overworld. I also added some caves and a small town to expand on the world's lore a bit. I think this is my best overworld so far.Difficulty Modes: To make the quest more accessible to different types of players, I've added different difficulty levels that change enemy damage. You can change difficulty at any time, but the game will keep track of the lowest you've played on.Fedora Hunt: There are a few megasecrets (items that do not show up on the subscreen) and easter eggs hidden around. See what you can find...\nI hope this update will be an enjoyable experience for new players and returning players alike.\n\nUpdate 3/22/2016: Fixed a few bugs and made some tweaks to some of the LP weapons.\nUpdate 4/25/2016: Addressed the common complaint about overhead layers obscuring enemies and tweaked the bonus boss some more.",

But things are not a they seem and a familiar foe is working from the shadows...",
    "tipsAndCheats": "As with Link's Quest for the Hookshot, you can always leave the dungeons and come back with more stuff you got with the dungeon items if you run into trouble.

    "description": "Two and a half years in the making, the sequel to Light of the Heavens DX is here! The Darkness Within is a large, story driven game, loaded with features, such as:\n\n-2 unique characters, each with their own playstyle.\n-Nearly every area from the first game is explorable, albeit they've changed a bit...\n-8 main levels\n-Fully scripted bosses (save for one)\n-Lots of scripted items\n-An intense story with three different endings\n-And more!",
    "story": "Two years have passed since Link and Rose struck down Dracus and saved the people of Palm Island. Their time since then has been spent traveling the seas, searching for somebody near and dear to Rose. Following a new lead, they return to Palm Island, expecting a fun reunion with friends. What they find instead are ruins, human remains, and an old foe, Lucis, driven to the brink of insanity.\n\nTo their relief, they soon find that most of the inhabitants of the island escaped safely. But their savior is none other than Dracus, the foe they thought they struck down two years ago. Claiming to have reformed, Dracus strikes a deal with them: they must team up in order to defeat the now-insane Lucis. With no other option, Link and Rose accept.\n\nSo many questions gnaw on their minds though. What's going on? Has Lucis really gone insane, or is something else more sinister at work here? Why did Dracus help all the people of Palm Island? And more importantly, has he really reformed? Can they really trust him?\n\nYou'll have to answer that last question yourself.",
    "tipsAndCheats": "-Exploring your surroundings will always help you out.\n-The first level has two heart halves hidden somewhere; each level after that has one.\n-Potions can be helpful; they'll fully restore your health four times. You start out with one freebie at the beginning of the game, and you're also given a freebie just before the final boss.\n-The ending system is based off three moral choices you make, so if the game seems to be hinting that something's important and gives you a choice, think carefully about what to do.\n-Remember to backtrack to old areas once you have new items; you might find rewards that were previously inaccessible.\n-DON'T quit in the middle of cutscenes. Nothing good comes out of it, and it might get you stuck.\n-The password to the quest is given out at the end, so you can go nuts with the quest if you want. Fair warning through: Excessive cheating will probably break the quest.",
    "credits": "First off, I want to thank three specific people, as this quest wouldn't be possible without them.\nMoosh was an unbelievable huge help. He scripted a good chunk of the game's items, taught me how to script the bosses, helped design one of the levels, beta tested, and constantly provided me with feedback. He also sprited the final boss. This game would have looked much different, and much worse, were it not for him.\nEvan20000 was also a huge help. He frequently gave me advice and feedback, and really helped with the difficulty balancing. His own quest was also a big inspiration to me at parts.\nFinally, SpacemanDan has helped me debug more scripts for this thing than I care to remember. He's also given me tons of genera advice and encouragement, and if that weren't enough, he's sprited a few things for the game too.\n\nNow, for credits in general:\nGraphics: Radien, for the DoR tileset. Peteo and DFW, for the Lost Isle tileset. SpacemanDan, for multiple sprites. Lightwulf, for misc sprites. Jupiter, for lots of trees. Linkus, for dungeon tiles. Scootaloo, for the Link tiles. Mariomario, for the Dracus sprites. Moosh, for the final boss sprites. Orin XD, for misc character sprites. Revfan9, for the horizon background. From the Spriter's Resource: Faty McGee, Smithygon, Robbydude, CrimsonPenguin, Mr. C, and Bean\nMusic: Alestance, Bjorn_Lynne, Espilan, Joan-Michele, Jormungand, Strato, Zagro, the contributors to the Original Midi Pack who were unnamed, and VGMusic submitters whose names I've unfortunately lost.\nSpecial mention for Alestance, who, in addition to writing a few songs, gave lots of suggestions, and compiled the Original Midi Pack that I frequently used.\nSFX: Helpthewretched, Jurassic Park.\nScripts/scripting help: Moosh, SpacemanDan, Saffith, SurrealCanine, and Joe123.\nBeta Testing: Moosh, Evan20000, SurrealCanine, and my own best friend who prefers to go unnamed.\nPost game bug finding: Special callout for Aevin, who's been a big help with those few bugs that slipped by.\nNone of this would have been possible without Nintendo, so they obviously get credit.\nAnd finally, you, for the taking the time to read this all and play the game.\n\nIf you deserve a place in the credits and I forgot to credit you, PLEASE let me know ASAP so I can give you proper credit",

    "description": "After finishing my latest classic quest remixes, I thought I was finished with the Classic Overworld. While I remain most devoted to the Classic tileset, I was intent on creating a wholy new quest, as a Classic Overworld can only be used so many times.\n\nIt was when I realized that many, if not most, Classic Overworld quests (with varying tilesets) were of a single layer that I realized that one can still add depth to a Classic Overworld quest with one tweak: multiple layers. In this case, I took the original, Classic Overworld, restuctured it with my version of a Classic graphics pack (namely palette, tiles, and combos), and added multiple layers to create taller trees, larger boulders, fences for bridges, microblocks in dungeons, etc. I hope with this quest, one can see the potential of any good tileset, so long as one uses layering to add depth to an otherwise single layer map.\n\nAfter the mostly positive feedback from First Quest Layered, I realized that a sequel was needed, so I crafted this quest with the same basic Overworld with small changes in topography and different locations of dungeons, items, and other secrets. This quest is slightly more difficult than its predecessor, particularly in puzzle solving.\n\nAs usual, I played this quest myself thoroughly and am certain everything should be working right. If there are any major bugs, do not rate the game, but do inform me and I will fix them as soon as I can. Also, I will continue to aesthetically update this quest as new tiles become available.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\n(Update 5/20/13): Fixed/improved various aesthetics:\n-Overworld, 4B: missing Layer 1 combos\n-Overworld, 5E: removed unnecessary Secret Combo Flags from Tall Grass edges made obsolete by \"Tall Grass –> Next\" Combos\n-Level 1, 52: removed unnecessary Secret Combo Flags from doorway\n-White Sword Palace, 13: turned on lights in block puzzle room to conserve player's Magic meter upon retrials\n-Level 8: restructured Side Warps transitioning from flooded to non-flooded areas\n-Level 8, 51: replaced \"Burn (Any)\" flag with \"Burn (Wand Fire)\" flag to necessitate acquisition of Magic Book\n\n(Update 5/23/13):\n-Shop 0: (closest one to starting point is one screen northwest) sells Large Magic Jars for 25 Rupees instead of Life Potions to allow for easier Magic refills\n-Overworld, screen 22: changed Shop to Potion Shop, now requires Mushroom (Letter) for commerce\n-Overworld, screen 50: benign Moblin now offers advice instead of free Rupees\n-Level 4, 02: teleport tile returns player just in front of the south doorway of the room, resets block puzzle to prevent player trapping oneself\n-Level 6, 42-52: middle doorway is now open, while right doorway is locked to allow access to block maze, require acquisition of another key, and avoid preventing player from completing dungeon\n\n(Update 12/24/13):\n-Overhaul of dungeon wall aesthetics.\n-Added a missing Map and Compass in Level 5.",

The minimum Heart Container requirements still apply (five for White, twelve for Magic), but each Sword Palace boss drops a full Heart Container when slain.\n\nSeven loose Heart Containers (i.e. those not dropped by slain dungeon bosses) have been split into twenty eight Heart Pieces. Most are scattered and hidden throughout the Overworld, but be on the lookout for a few hidden in dungeons as well.\n\nThis quest enforces the use of a Magic meter, which begins at four blocks. There are four extra Magic Containers hidden in either the Overworld or in one of the dungeons.\n\nVisit Info booths around the Overworld and Old Men in dungeons for hints as to how and where to obtain certain items and where to find the entrance to certain dungeons.\n\nThe final few dungeons can be a challenge. Unless you have impeccable memory, I suggest players to write down notes, sketches, etc. when exploring the later dungeons. You do not want to forget where one-way shutters are located!\n\nWhile most of the enemies are the same as before, others have been changed dramatically. Three notable examples are the Lynel, the Gibdo, and the Pols Voice:\n-Lynels no longer pause to shoot fire blasts and now charge at you when standing in its line of sight.\n-Gibdos can now grab onto you and drain your vitality until destroyed.\n-Pols Voice are no longer very weak to arrows but can be instantly killed with something else; however, the Ocarina (Whistle) is not effective enough to injure the ears.",

Also fixed a misplaced trigger in Level 2.UPDATE 5: Removed the 'Enemies Always Return' rule seeing the amount of people who hated it.UPDATE 6: Made the final Mirror Amy more easier so that it won't be a nuisance to go through. Also replaced all MP3s with MIDIs.UPDATE 7: Made the minor Mirror Amy battles a lot easier.UPDATE 8: Final update until any further notice. Fixed plenty of bugs and changed around difficulty again.UPDATE 9: Added a few money-dropping enemies in the final boss (more specifically Mecha Shadow's phase) to prevent any mess ups.UPDATE 10: Made the Desert of Doubt far easier to navigate due to its horrific trial and error gimmicks. I also fixed the shieldless sprites of Blue Darknuts.UPDATE 11: Fairly minor update, but changed the graphics of every Moon Gate (portals) in the quest so that they no longer look badly sprited.UPDATE 12: Fixed up some cutscene errors at the final fight and you can now see yourself more clearly on the dungeon map.UPDATE 13: Fixed even more bugs with the final fight (thanks to Cukeman for pointing these out)",
    "story": "Sonic and his team where flying on their spaceship looking for distant lands and worlds far away from Mobius. They came across Hyrule in which they discover that Robotnik has managed to destroy this 'Evil' that has been conquering Hyrule for centries. With added power, Robotnik claims to take over both Hyrule and Mobius at the same time by getting the 'Light Force' or Triforce to add on even more to his new power. Amy gets aggrevated and claims she'll get the full Triforce before Robotnik does. Robotnik then makes a challenge for Amy which is to collect all 8 pieces of Triforce when her abilites and items are removed, in other words, she must start from scratch. She sets out on a long journey through Hyrule to collect the pieces of Triforce and save Hyrule from being overrun by Robotnik.(Full, detailed and more humorous story in the intro of the quest)",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- When you get the Lens, be sure to use it quite often if you find yourself stuck, they will reveal secrets to you.\n- Be sure to visit the Temple of Armour and the Temple of Swords after Levels 2, 5 and 8 to get upgrades.\n- Come back to the Take 'Em All On challenge after Level 1 to get a Heart Piece and Levels 5 and 7 to get scrolls for the sword.\n- When coming across block puzzles, ALWAYS plan ahead before going straight into solving them, there's a huge possiblility that you may screw up.\n- If you find a dungeon too difficult, use Potions to help or search for Heart Pieces in the overworld to get you stronger.\n- If you're going for a 100% run, remember to go back to older caves that you couldn't progress before, you are most likely to find either 50 force gems or a Heart Piece.\nThere is currently a video walkthrough on this quest, use it if you're completely stuck: http://www.youtube.c...h?v=ZzyxlyBnHBA",

ThatRandomGuy also helped with this and that while this quest was being made.Thanks to the following people who helped betatest this and tweak its difficulty for the masses: Dustminion, Mr.Z, CaptainObvious.",

    "description": "WARNING\nQuest contains suggestive text strings and \"jokes\" that may not be appropriate for a younger audience. Some things in the quest could even potentially be construed as stereotypical or bigoted, albeit on a very mild scale. Most probably won't agree with that notion, but I advise against playing this if you are easily offended.\n\n\nDevelopment\nThis is the sibling quest to Rambly's I Hate Mayonnaise 2: Depressive Donuts, and the \"sequel\" to Ibuprofen. We wanted to release both quests in the same period, but due largely to motivational issues on my end, that didn't happen.\n\nDesign on this quest began during the end of November '09, when I had the motivation to do another \"joke\"-esque quest. I originally intended to release this quest during Christmas of the same year, but the work I was putting in didn't allow for such a quick release.\n\nThe bulk of the quest was finished within the next year or two, but I wanted to add a bunch of secrets to the quest. A large, extra dungeon kept the game in development limbo for the next couple of years, as I couldn't bring myself to work on it very much. My preference for a lot of the things in the quest changed over time, but I couldn't motivate myself to work on those, either. I did, however, manage to transition this quest from 1.92 to 2.50. It still plays like a 1.92 quest, but has the added convenience of arrow ammunition, and a revised subscreen.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the quest wasn't going to have all the other things I wanted to add, so I decided to tie up the loose ends, and release it as-is. My original goal was to be more satisfied with this than its prequel, and I managed to accomplish that long ago.\n\n\nAbout the Quest\nIf you've played Ibuprofen, then you already kind of know what to expect. The quest still has an overall very simplistic design to it, and it progresses almost exactly the same as the last quest. There's just a lot more creativity in this one.\n\nThe dungeons in this quest are something of a novelty display. They aren't very complex, either.\n\nAs the sibling quest to IHM2, this quest shares a couple of perks: You start with farore's wind, and there's a \"death tree\".\n\nThe difficulty may be considered average by most. The final dungeon is harder than the bulk of the game.\nOn this note, some enemies (aquamentus, gleeok, and ganon) were buffed. Death knights were nerfed; they move no faster than Link, do less damage, and stop moving before firing. Mirrorobes were also nerfed; they do less damage.\n\nThe quest also features custom SFX. Lots. Its the primary culprit of the file size.\n\nThe quest name, like its predecessor, is irrelevant to the actual game. It has personal significance to me, but nothing more.",
    "story": "The \"story\" is essentially no different than its prequel:\"The Ghost of Christmas Future kidnaps Zelda and takes Link's Lon Lon Milk. Link's pretty mad.\"",
    "tipsAndCheats": "Each and every dungeon has a secret room that contains an optional item. There are no blatant hints on-screen as how to obtain these, but that's not an issue if you keep this in mind: The secret rooms in conjunction with the displayed map make the dungeon shape symmetrical (with the exception of two dungeons). All of these items are completely optional, but they can make the game easier if acquired ASAP. As for the exceptions... Level 2 has two rooms, and they are situated somewhere at the upper section of the dungeon. The item dungeon, however... that's up to you!If a concealed entrance on the overworld looks a bit too simple to uncover, you probably shouldn't go inside.There are a total of 16 hearts in this quest; you have the primary 12 as with the last quest, and 4 very well-hidden ones.Every B-button item slot can be filled. The blue candle is the only item that does not appear.The lens of truth drains magic instead of rupees (as was the case with Ibuprofen). Din's fire also consumes magic.All equipment slots can be filled. Obtainable equipment includes: Wooden/white/magic/master swords, ladder, flippers, magic meter, blue/red/gold rings, magic/mirror shields, power bracelets, amulet, boots, and din's fire. You begin with 500 rupees, farore's wind, the quiver, and the \"letter\". The wealth medal and the raft are also obtainable, but are well-hidden.The level 1 cheat is hidden in the quest. I will not disclose what it is, or where it is located.And for those whom didn't know already, if the quest author has enabled the Z3-styled boomerang/hookshot rule, the magic boomerang blocks magic, and the fire boomerang reflects it. To tell if this rule is enabled, items will be \"pulled\" back to you when they make contact with the boomerang or hookshot. If they're instantly acquired, the rule is off. The rule is enabled in this quest. Please don't forget it!",

Fixed some graphical errors (barring pallette issues, but I didn't understand sprite palettes when I made this, and I don't want to fix it... The bosses will look bad, so just kill them in mercy.)

Red Lynel Swords now only do 1 Heart (4 HP) of damage (in line with the BS-Zelda fix)4. Death Knights have been nerfed: Their swords now do 40 damage, in line with their contact damage5. Mirrorrobes have been nerfed back to their 1.92 B 183 level, only taking 3 shots to kill (hopefully). Whomever powered them up IDK why.6. Boss effects put in (New Quest was so early in ZC Development this feature was overlooked)7. Gleeoks are now hurt by wand magic, putting them in line with the manual saying they're hurt by both sword AND wand.8. First room of Blue Goriyas taken down to 3 of them.New Bosses:1. Level 1 - Digdogger - 25 HP, does 1 heart of damage instead of 2.2. Level 4 - Gohma - 25 HP, does more damage. He's an old crab now. ;-)3. Level 5 - Gleeok - bumped from 3 heads to 4 heads4. Level 7 - Gleeok - bumped from 4 heads to 10 heads5. Level 8 - Patra - No longer 3 Patras, but one Big Circle one with more HP (50) for the center and double HP (24) for the eyes. It also shoots fireballs now. It's also different color to differentiate itself from the Lv. 6 Patra and the normal enemy Patras.6. Level 11 - Gleeok - Now has 40 heads legitimately7. Level 11 - Fire Gleeok - Now has a ton more HP and only 4 heads, a real boss fight now. This might be buffed for more HP pending playtesting.UPDATE: Version 4.0.  This is the final version.  I fixed the Digdogger issue and the Game Icon problem, as well as making this more stable.  This is \"as is\" from this point on, unless something's extremely gamebreaking, this is as stable as I can make it for future builds.

    "story": "Dr Devar. A name that had been circulating a lot recently in certain academic circles. An archeologist, in search of an ancient civilization that most scholars agreed was nothing more than legend. He was either determined or insane, depending on who you asked.\n\nHe was an ass, though, if you asked Elliot Devar. The archeologist's teenage son didn't have much respect at all for his father. The man was two-faced. Kind and enthusiastic in front of a camera, but mean, almost abusive, when in private. Elliot found his father's field of work fascinating, but resented being dragged around from place to place and being forced to do all the hard work. \"Go through this small tunnel, Elliot.\" \"Carry my tools for me, Elliot.\" \"Don't you dare sass off to me or I will make your life miserable, Elliot.\"\n\nMean as his father might be though, Elliot never had any reason to suspect he was any more than an egotistical jerk. Until one day, when his father sent him crawling through yet another muddy tunnel in a cave to scout ahead. On the other side though, Elliot found something quite different than normal. A hallway, lined with crumbling pillars, ending in a sealed door. And a glove, and a voice beckoning him to pick up the glove...\n\nElliot's life collapsed in that moment, as the glove spoke, explaining things Elliot didn't want to hear. His father was searching for something, something called the Vault of Souls. And if he were to find and open it, it would mean catastrophe. Elliot is forced into a search to locate the three key shards to seal the vault before Dr Devar can reach it, in a quest that could ultimately pit father against son in a showdown that, despite how they might act on the outside, neither of them want to happen.\n\nThe Vault of Souls is discovered. Hurry, Elliot...",
    "tipsAndCheats": "- Explore after every level: the items you get will let you unlock new areas and find helpful upgrades.- On that note, take advantage of the upgrades and abilities systems. Enemies get progressively difficult as the game goes on, so you gotta make sure you stay ahead of them- Electricity is strong against water which is strong against fire which is strong against electricity. Therefore, it pays to do the dungeons in a certain order. You can start with any of them, but going around clockwise from there will make things easier for you.",
